/**
 * A type containing error details that is returned by the compile calls (\ref
 * hs_compile(), \ref hs_compile_multi() and \ref hs_compile_ext_multi()) on
 * failure. The caller may inspect the values returned in this type to
 * determine the cause of failure.
 *
 * Common errors generated during the compile process include:
 *
 *    - *Invalid parameter*
 *
 *      An invalid argument was specified in the compile call.
 *
 *    - *Unrecognised flag*
 *
 *      An unrecognised value was passed in the flags argument.
 *
 *    - *Pattern matches empty buffer*
 *
 *      By default, Hyperscan only supports patterns that will *always*
 *      consume at least one byte of input. Patterns that do not have this
 *      property (such as {@code /(abc)?/}) will produce this error unless
 *      the \ref HS_FLAG_ALLOWEMPTY flag is supplied. Note that such
 *      patterns will produce a match for *every* byte when scanned.
 *
 *    - *Embedded anchors not supported*
 *
 *      Hyperscan only supports the use of anchor meta-characters (such as
 *      {@code ^} and {@code $}) in patterns where they could *only* match
 *      at the start or end of a buffer. A pattern containing an embedded
 *      anchor, such as {@code /abc^def/}, can never match, as there is no
 *      way for {@code abc} to precede the start of the data stream.
 *
 *    - *Bounded repeat is too large*
 *
 *      The pattern contains a repeated construct with very large finite
 *      bounds.
 *
 *    - *Unsupported component type*
 *
 *      An unsupported PCRE construct was used in the pattern.
 *
 *    - *Unable to generate bytecode*
 *
 *      This error indicates that Hyperscan was unable to compile a pattern
 *      that is syntactically valid. The most common cause is a pattern that is
 *      very long and complex or contains a large repeated subpattern.
 *
 *    - *Unable to allocate memory*
 *
 *      The library was unable to allocate temporary storage used during
 *      compilation time.
 *
 *    - *Allocator returned misaligned memory*
 *
 *      The memory allocator (either malloc() or the allocator set with \ref
 *      hs_set_allocator()) did not correctly return memory suitably aligned
 *      for the largest representable data type on this platform.
 *
 *    - *Internal error*
 *
 *      An unexpected error occurred: if this error is reported, please contact
 *      the Hyperscan team with a description of the situation.
