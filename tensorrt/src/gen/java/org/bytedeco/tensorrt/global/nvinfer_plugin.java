     *  (i.e., lying in the interval [0, 1]) or absolute.
     *  The plugin expects two inputs.

     *  q, 4], where q can be either 1 (if shareLocation is true) or num_classes.

     *  The plugin returns four outputs.
     *  num_detections : A [batch_size] int32 tensor indicating the number of valid
     *  detections per batch item. Can be less than keepTopK. Only the top num_detections[i] entries in
     *  nmsed_boxes[i], nmsed_scores[i] and nmsed_classes[i] are valid.
