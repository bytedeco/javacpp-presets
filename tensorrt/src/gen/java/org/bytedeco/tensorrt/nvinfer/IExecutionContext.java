     *  When an optimization profile is switched via this API, TensorRT may

     *  the profile sync stream and the enqueue stream occurs.
     * 
     *  The selected profile will be used in subsequent calls to execute() or
     *  enqueue().
     *  If the associated CUDA engine has inputs with dynamic shapes, the
     *  optimization profile must be set with a unique profileIndex before
     *  calling execute or enqueue.
     *  For the first execution context that is created for an engine,
     *  setOptimizationProfile(0) is called implicitly.
     * 
     *  If the associated CUDA engine does not have inputs with dynamic shapes,
     *  this method need not be called, in which case the default profile index
     *  of 0 will be used.
     * 
     *  setOptimizationProfileAsync() must be called before calling
     *  setBindingDimensions() and setInputShapeBinding() for all dynamic input
     *  tensors or input shape tensors, which in turn must be called before
     *  either execute() or enqueue().
