     *  \brief A thread-safe callback implemented by the application to resize an existing allocation.
     * 
     *  Only allocations which were allocated with AllocatorFlag::kRESIZABLE will be resized.
     * 
     *  Options are one of:
     *  * resize in place leaving min(oldSize, newSize) bytes unchanged and return the original address
     *  * move min(oldSize, newSize) bytes to a new location of sufficient size and return its address
     *  * return nullptr, to indicate that the request could not be fulfilled.
     * 
     *  If nullptr is returned, TensorRT will assume that resize() is not implemented, and that the
     *  allocation at baseAddr is still valid.
     * 
     *  This method is made available for use cases where delegating the resize
     *  strategy to the application provides an opportunity to improve memory management.
     *  One possible implementation is to allocate a large virtual device buffer and
     *  progressively commit physical memory with cuMemMap. CU_MEM_ALLOC_GRANULARITY_RECOMMENDED
     *  is suggested in this case.
     * 
     *  TensorRT may call realloc to increase the buffer by relatively small amounts.
     * 
     *  @param baseAddr the address of the original allocation, which will have been returned by previously calling
     *         allocate() or reallocate() on the same object.
     *  @param alignment The alignment used by the original allocation. This will be the same value that was previously
     *         passed to the allocate() or reallocate() call that returned baseAddr.
     *  @param newSize The new memory size required (in bytes).
     * 
     *  @return The address of the reallocated memory, or nullptr. If a non-null address is returned, it is
     *          guaranteed to have the specified alignment.
     * 
     *  \note The implementation must guarantee thread safety for concurrent allocate/reallocate/deallocate
     *  requests.
