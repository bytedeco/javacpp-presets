/** \class IShuffleLayer
 * 
 *  \brief Layer type for shuffling data.
 * 
 *  This class shuffles data by applying in sequence: a transpose operation, a reshape operation
 *  and a second transpose operation. The dimension types of the output are those of the reshape dimension.
 * 
 *  The layer has an optional second input.  If present, it must be a 1D Int32 shape tensor,
 *  and the reshape dimensions are taken from it.
 * 
 *  \warning Do not inherit from this class, as doing so will break forward-compatibility of the API and ABI.
