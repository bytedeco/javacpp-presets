/**
 *  \class IErrorRecorder
 * 
 *  \brief Reference counted application-implemented error reporting interface for TensorRT objects.
 * 
 *  The error reporting mechanism is a user defined object that interacts with the internal state of the object
 *  that it is assigned to in order to determine information about abnormalities in execution. The error recorder
 *  gets both an error enum that is more descriptive than pass/fail and also a string description that gives more
 *  detail on the exact failure modes. In the safety context, the error strings are all limited to 1024 characters
 *  in length.
 * 
 *  The ErrorRecorder gets passed along to any class that is created from another class that has an ErrorRecorder
 *  assigned to it. For example, assigning an ErrorRecorder to an IBuilder allows all INetwork's, ILayer's, and
 *  ITensor's to use the same error recorder. For functions that have their own ErrorRecorder accessor functions.
 *  This allows registering a different error recorder or de-registering of the error recorder for that specific
 *  object.
 * 
 *  The ErrorRecorder object implementation must be thread safe. All locking and synchronization is pushed to the
 *  interface implementation and TensorRT does not hold any synchronization primitives when accessing the interface
 *  functions.
 * 
 *  The lifetime of the ErrorRecorder object must exceed the lifetime of all TensorRT objects that use it.
