In compliance with restriction 2 specified in COPYING.txt, this file
indicates that this distribution has been modified. It is based on
GLFW 3.1.2, available from http://www.glfw.org/. It has had glfw_config.h
pre-generated and Visual Studio projects have been generated. This is to
make it easier to use GLFW3 on Windows, where robust package management
facilities are not broadly available.
