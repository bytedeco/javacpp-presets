/** \brief A group of related tasks
 * 
 *  A TaskGroup executes tasks with the signature {@code Status()}.
 *  Execution can be serial or parallel, depending on the TaskGroup
 *  implementation.  When Finish() returns, it is guaranteed that all
 *  tasks have finished, or at least one has errored.
 * 
 *  Once an error has occurred any tasks that are submitted to the task group
 *  will not run.  The call to Append will simply return without scheduling the
 *  task.
 * 
 *  If the task group is parallel it is possible that multiple tasks could be
 *  running at the same time and one of those tasks fails.  This will put the
 *  task group in a failure state (so additional tasks cannot be run) however
 *  it will not interrupt running tasks.  Finish will not complete
 *  until all running tasks have finished, even if one task fails.
 * 
 *  Once a task group has finished new tasks may not be added to it.  If you need to start
 *  a new batch of work then you should create a new task group. */
