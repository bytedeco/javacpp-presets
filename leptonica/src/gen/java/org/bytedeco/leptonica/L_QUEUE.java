/**
 * \file queue.h
 *
 * <pre>
 *      Expandable pointer queue for arbitrary void* data.
 *
 *      The L_Queue is a fifo that implements a queue of void* pointers.
 *      It can be used to hold a queue of any type of struct.
 *
 *      Internally, it maintains two counters:
 *          nhead:  location of head (in ptrs) from the beginning
 *                  of the array.
 *          nelem:  number of ptr elements stored in the queue.
 *
 *      The element at the head of the queue, which is the next to
 *      be removed, is array[nhead].  The location at the tail of the
 *      queue to which the next element will be added is
 *      array[nhead + nelem].
 *
 *      As items are added to the queue, nelem increases.
 *      As items are removed, nhead increases and nelem decreases.
 *      Any time the tail reaches the end of the allocated array,
 *      all the pointers are shifted to the left, so that the head
 *      is at the beginning of the array.
 *      If the array becomes more than 3/4 full, it doubles in size.
 *
 *      The auxiliary stack can be used in a wrapper for re-using
 *      items popped from the queue.  It is not made by default.
 *
 *      For further implementation details, see queue.c.
 * </pre>
