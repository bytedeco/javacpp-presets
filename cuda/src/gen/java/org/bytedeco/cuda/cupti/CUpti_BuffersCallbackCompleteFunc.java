/**
 * \brief Function type for callback used by CUPTI to return a buffer
 * of activity records.
 *
 * This callback function returns to the CUPTI client a buffer
 * containing activity records.  The buffer contains \p validSize
 * bytes of activity records which should be read using
 * cuptiActivityGetNextRecord. The number of dropped records can be
 * read using cuptiActivityGetNumDroppedRecords. After this call CUPTI
 * relinquished ownership of the buffer and will not use it
 * anymore. The client may return the buffer to CUPTI using the
 * CUpti_BuffersCallbackRequestFunc callback.
 * Note: CUDA 6.0 onwards, all buffers returned by this callback are
 * global buffers i.e. there is no context/stream specific buffer.
 * User needs to parse the global buffer to extract the context/stream
 * specific activity records.
 *
 * @param context The context this buffer is associated with. If NULL, the
 * buffer is associated with the global activities. This field is deprecated
 * as of CUDA 6.0 and will always be NULL.
 * @param streamId The stream id this buffer is associated with.
 * This field is deprecated as of CUDA 6.0 and will always be NULL.
 * @param buffer The activity record buffer.
 * @param size The total size of the buffer in bytes as set in
 * CUpti_BuffersCallbackRequestFunc.
 * @param validSize The number of valid bytes in the buffer.
