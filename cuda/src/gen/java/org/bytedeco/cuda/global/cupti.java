     * kernels (activity kind \ref CUPTI_ACTIVITY_KIND_CONCURRENT_KERNEL), memcopies and memsets
     * for each buffer on a context. The value is a size_t.
     *
     * There is a limit on how many device buffers can be allocated per context. User
     * can query and set this limit using the attribute
     * \ref CUPTI_ACTIVITY_ATTR_DEVICE_BUFFER_POOL_LIMIT.
     * CUPTI doesn't pre-allocate all the buffers, it pre-allocates only those many
     * buffers as set by the attribute \ref CUPTI_ACTIVITY_ATTR_DEVICE_BUFFER_PRE_ALLOCATE_VALUE.
     * When all of the data in a buffer is consumed, it is added in the reuse pool, and
     * CUPTI picks a buffer from this pool when a new buffer is needed. Thus memory
     * footprint does not scale with the kernel count. Applications with the high density
     * of kernels, memcopies and memsets might result in having CUPTI to allocate more device buffers.
     * CUPTI allocates another buffer only when it runs out of the buffers in the
     * reuse pool.
     *
     * Since buffer allocation happens in the main application thread, this might result
     * in stalls in the critical path. CUPTI pre-allocates 3 buffers of the same size to
     * mitigate this issue. User can query and set the pre-allocation limit using the
     * attribute \ref CUPTI_ACTIVITY_ATTR_DEVICE_BUFFER_PRE_ALLOCATE_VALUE.
     *
     * Having larger buffer size leaves less device memory for the application.
     * Having smaller buffer size increases the risk of dropping timestamps for
     * records if too many kernels or memcopies or memsets are launched at one time.
     *
     * This value only applies to new buffer allocations. Set this value before initializing
     * CUDA or before creating a context to ensure it is considered for the following allocations.
     *
     * The default value is 3200000 (~3MB) which can accommodate profiling data
     * up to 100,000 kernels, memcopies and memsets combined.
     *
     * Note: Starting with the CUDA 12.0 Update 1 release, CUPTI allocates profiling buffer in the
     * device memory by default as this might help in improving the performance of the
     * tracing run. Refer to the description of the attribute
     * \ref CUPTI_ACTIVITY_ATTR_MEM_ALLOCATION_TYPE_HOST_PINNED for more details.
     * Size of the memory and maximum number of pools are still controlled by the attributes
     * \ref CUPTI_ACTIVITY_ATTR_DEVICE_BUFFER_SIZE and \ref CUPTI_ACTIVITY_ATTR_DEVICE_BUFFER_POOL_LIMIT.
     *

/**
 * \brief Read the values for all the events in an event group.
 *
 * Read the values for all the events in an event group. The event
 * values are returned in the \p eventValueBuffer buffer. \p
 * eventValueBufferSizeBytes indicates the size of \p
 * eventValueBuffer.  The buffer must be at least (sizeof(uint64) *
 * number of events in group) if
 * ::CUPTI_EVENT_GROUP_ATTR_PROFILE_ALL_DOMAIN_INSTANCES is not set on
 * the group containing the events.  The buffer must be at least
 * (sizeof(uint64) * number of domain instances * number of events in
 * group) if ::CUPTI_EVENT_GROUP_ATTR_PROFILE_ALL_DOMAIN_INSTANCES is
 * set on the group.
 *
 * The data format returned in \p eventValueBuffer is:
 *    - domain instance 0: event0 event1 ... eventN
 *    - domain instance 1: event0 event1 ... eventN
 *    - ...
 *    - domain instance M: event0 event1 ... eventN
 *
 * The event order in \p eventValueBuffer is returned in \p
 * eventIdArray. The size of \p eventIdArray is specified in \p
 * eventIdArraySizeBytes. The size should be at least
 * (sizeof(CUpti_EventID) * number of events in group).
 *
 * If any instance of any event counter overflows, the value returned
 * for that event instance will be ::CUPTI_EVENT_OVERFLOW.
 *
 * The only allowed value for \p flags is ::CUPTI_EVENT_READ_FLAG_NONE.
 *
 * Reading events from a disabled event group is not allowed. After
 * being read, an event's value is reset to zero.
 * \note \b Thread-safety: this function is thread safe but client
 * must guard against simultaneous destruction or modification of \p
 * eventGroup (for example, client must guard against simultaneous
 * calls to \ref cuptiEventGroupDestroy, \ref cuptiEventGroupAddEvent,
 * etc.), and must guard against simultaneous destruction of the
 * context in which \p eventGroup was created (for example, client
 * must guard against simultaneous calls to cudaDeviceReset,
 * cuCtxDestroy, etc.). If \ref cuptiEventGroupResetAllEvents is
 * called simultaneously with this function, then returned event
 * values are undefined.
 *
 * @param eventGroup The event group
 * @param flags Flags controlling the reading mode
 * @param eventValueBufferSizeBytes The size of \p eventValueBuffer in
 * bytes, and returns the number of bytes written to \p
 * eventValueBuffer
 * @param eventValueBuffer Returns the event values
 * @param eventIdArraySizeBytes The size of \p eventIdArray in bytes,
 * and returns the number of bytes written to \p eventIdArray
 * @param eventIdArray Returns the IDs of the events in the same order
