JavaCPP Presets
===============

Introduction
------------
The JavaCPP Presets module contains Java configuration and interface classes for widely used C/C++ libraries. The configuration files in the `org.bytedeco.javacpp.presets` package are used by the `Parser` to create from C/C++ header files the Java interface files targeting the `org.bytedeco.javacpp` package, which is turn are used by the `Generator` and the native C++ compiler to produce the required JNI libraries. Moreover, helper classes make their functionality easier to use on the Java platform, including Android.

Please refer to the wiki page for more information about how to [create new presets](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/wiki/Create-New-Presets). Since additional documentation is currently lacking, please also feel free to ask questions on [the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/javacpp-project).


Downloads
---------
 * JavaCPP Presets 0.9 binary archive  [javacpp-presets-0.9-bin.zip](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/0.9/javacpp-presets-0.9-bin.zip) (198 MB)
 * JavaCPP Presets 0.9 source archive  [javacpp-presets-0.9-src.zip](http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/0.9/javacpp-presets-0.9-src.zip) (1156 KB)

The binary archive contains builds for Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, and Android.


We can also have everything downloaded and installed automatically with:

 * Maven (inside the `pom.xml` file)
```xml
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.bytedeco.javacpp-presets</groupId>
    <artifactId>${moduleName}</artifactId>
    <version>${moduleVersion}-0.9</version>
  </dependency>
```

 * Gradle (inside the `build.gradle` file)
```groovy
  dependencies {
    compile group: 'org.bytedeco.javacpp-presets', name: moduleName, version: moduleVersion + '-0.9'
  }
```

* SBT (inside the `build.sbt` file)
```scala
  libraryDependencies += "org.bytedeco.javacpp-presets" % moduleName % moduleVersion + "-0.9"
```

where the `moduleName` and `moduleVersion` variables correspond to the desired module. Additionally, we need to either set the `platform.dependency` system property to something like `android-arm`, or set the `platform.dependencies` one to `true` to get all the binaries for Linux, Mac OS X, and Windows.


Required Software
-----------------
To use the JavaCPP Presets, you will need to download and install the following software:

 * An implementation of Java SE 6 or newer
   * OpenJDK  http://openjdk.java.net/install/  or
   * Sun JDK  http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/  or
   * IBM JDK  http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/  or
   * Java SE for Mac OS X  http://developer.apple.com/java/  etc.


Build Instructions
------------------
To rebuild the source code on the Java side, please note that the project files were created for:

 * Maven 2 or 3  http://maven.apache.org/download.html
 * JavaCPP 0.9  https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp

Each child module in turn relies on its corresponding native libraries being already installed in the `cppbuild` subdirectory by a prior execution of the included [CPPBuild Scripts](#cppbuild-scripts), explained below. To use native libraries already installed somewhere else on the system, other installation directories than `cppbuild` can also be specified in the `.java` configuration files directly. The following versions are supported:

 * OpenCV 2.4.9  http://opencv.org/downloads.html
 * Libav master  http://libav.org/download.html
 * FlyCapture 2.6.x  http://ww2.ptgrey.com/sdk/flycap
 * FFmpeg 2.3.x  http://ffmpeg.org/download.html
 * PGR FlyCapture 1.7 or newer (Windows only)  http://www.ptgrey.com/products/pgrflycapture/
 * libdc1394 2.1.x or 2.2.x  http://sourceforge.net/projects/libdc1394/files/
 * libfreenect 0.5  https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect
 * videoInput 0.200  https://github.com/ofTheo/videoInput/tree/update2013
 * ARToolKitPlus 2.3.0  https://launchpad.net/artoolkitplus
 * flandmark 1.07  http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/~uricamic/flandmark/#download
 * FFTW 3.3.4  http://www.fftw.org/download.html
 * GSL 1.16  http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/#downloading
 * LLVM 3.4.2  http://llvm.org/releases/download.html
 * Leptonica 1.71  http://www.leptonica.org/download.html
 * Tesseract 3.03-rc1  https://code.google.com/p/tesseract-ocr/

Once everything installed and configured, simply execute
```bash
$ mvn install --projects opencv,libav,ffmpeg,flycapture,libdc1394,libfreenect,videoinput,artoolkitplus,etc.
```
inside the directory containing the parent `pom.xml` file, by specifying only the desired child modules in the command. Please refer to the comments inside the `pom.xml` file for further details.


CPPBuild Scripts
----------------
To build native libraries on the native C/C++ side, additional software is required:

 * A recent version of Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows with MSYS and the Windows SDK
 * Android NDK r7 or newer  http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/  (required only for Android builds)

With the above in working order, simply execute
```bash
$ ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/android-ndk/ bash cppbuild.sh [-platform <name>] [<install | clean>] [projects]
```
where potential platform names include: `android-arm`, `android-x86`, `linux-x86`, `linux-x86_64`, `macosx-x86_64`, `windows-x86`, `windows-x86_64`, etc. (The `ANDROID_NDK` variable is required only for Android builds.)

To compile binaries for an Android device with no FPU, first make sure this is what you want. Without FPU, the performance of either OpenCV or FFmpeg is bound to be unacceptable. If you still wish to continue down that road, then replace "armeabi-v7a" by "armeabi" and "-march=armv7-a -mfloat-abi=softfp -mfpu=vfpv3-d16" with "-march=armv5te -mtune=xscale -msoft-float", inside various files.

Although JavaCPP can pick up native libraries installed on the system, the scripts exist to facilitate the build process across multiple platforms. They also allow JavaCPP to copy the native libraries and load them at runtime from the JAR files created above by Maven, a useful feature for standalone applications or Java applets. Moreover, tricks such as the following work with JNLP:
```xml
    <resources os="Linux" arch="x86 i386 i486 i586 i686">
        <jar href="lib/opencv-linux-x86.jar"/>
        <jar href="lib/ffmpeg-linux-x86.jar"/>
    </resources>
    <resources os="Linux" arch="x86_64 amd64">
        <jar href="lib/opencv-linux-x86_64.jar"/>
        <jar href="lib/ffmpeg-linux-x86_64.jar"/>
    </resources>
```

Thanks to Jose GÃ³mez for testing this out!


Quick Start
-----------
Simply put all the desired JAR files (`opencv*.jar`, `ffmpeg*.jar`, `flycapture*.jar`, `libdc1394*.jar`, `libfreenect*.jar`, `videoinput*.jar`, and `artoolkitplus*.jar`, etc.), in addition to `javacpp.jar`, somewhere in your CLASSPATH, or point your build file to the [Maven Central Repository](http://search.maven.org/#search|ga|1|bytedeco), when the binary files are present. The JAR files found in these artifacts are meant to be used with [JavaCPP](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp). They were built on Fedora 20, so they may not work on all distributions of Linux, especially older ones. The binaries for Android were compiled for ARMv7 processors featuring an FPU, so they will not work on ancient devices such as the HTC Magic or some others with an ARMv6 CPU. Here are some more specific instructions for common cases:

NetBeans (Java SE 6 or newer):

 1. In the Projects window, right-click the Libraries node of your project, and select "Add JAR/Folder...".
 2. Locate the JAR files, select them, and click OK.

Eclipse (Java SE 6 or newer):

 1. Navigate to Project > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries and click "Add External JARs...".
 2. Locate the JAR files, select them, and click OK.

Eclipse (Android 2.2 or newer):

 1. Follow the instructions on this page: http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/
 2. Go to File > New > Folder, select your project as parent folder, type "libs/armeabi" as Folder name, and click Finish.
 3. Copy `javacpp.jar`, `opencv.jar`, `ffmpeg.jar`, and `artoolkitplus.jar` into the newly created "libs" folder.
 4. Extract all the `*.so` files from `opencv-android-arm.jar`, `ffmpeg-android-arm.jar`, and `artoolkitplus-android-arm.jar` directly into the newly created "libs/armeabi" folder, without creating any of the subdirectories found in the JAR files.
 5. Navigate to Project > Properties > Java Build Path > Libraries and click "Add JARs...".
 6. Select all of `javacpp.jar`, `opencv.jar`, `ffmpeg.jar`, and `artoolkitplus.jar` from the newly created "libs" folder.

After that, we can access almost transparently the corresponding C/C++ APIs through the interface classes found in the `org.bytedeco.javacpp` package. Indeed, the `Parser` translates the code comments from the C/C++ header files into the Java interface files, (almost) ready to be consumed by Javadoc. However, since their translation still leaves to be desired, one may wish to refer to the original documentation pages. For instance, the ones for OpenCV and FFmpeg can be found online at:

 * [OpenCV documentation](http://docs.opencv.org/)
 * [FFmpeg documentation](http://ffmpeg.org/doxygen/)


How Can I Help?
---------------
Contributions of any kind are highly welcome! At the moment, the `Parser` has limited capabilities, so I plan to improve it gradually to the point where it can successfully parse large C++ header files that are even more convoluted than the ones from OpenCV, but the build system could also be improved. Consequently, I am looking for help especially with the four following tasks, in no particular order:

 * Improving the `Parser`
 * Providing builds for more platforms, most notably `linux-arm`
 * Replacing the Bash/Maven build combo by something better (Gradle?)
 * Adding new presets as child modules for other C/C++ libraries (OpenNI, OpenMesh, PCL, etc.)

To contribute, please fork and create pull requests, or post your suggestions [as a new "issue"](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/issues). Thank you very much in advance for your contribution!
