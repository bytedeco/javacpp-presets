/*
Overview:

btConeTwistConstraint can be used to simulate ragdoll joints (upper arm, leg etc).
It is a fixed translation, 3 degree-of-freedom (DOF) rotational "joint".
It divides the 3 rotational DOFs into swing (movement within a cone) and twist.
Swing is divided into swing1 and swing2 which can have different limits, giving an elliptical shape.
(Note: the cone's base isn't flat, so this ellipse is "embedded" on the surface of a sphere.)

In the contraint's frame of reference:
twist is along the x-axis,
and swing 1 and 2 are along the z and y axes respectively.

/*
2014 May: btGeneric6DofSpring2Constraint is created from the original (2.82.2712) btGeneric6DofConstraint by Gabor Puhr and Tamas Umenhoffer
Pros:
- Much more accurate and stable in a lot of situation. (Especially when a sleeping chain of RBs connected with 6dof2 is pulled)
- Stable and accurate spring with minimal energy loss that works with all of the solvers. (latter is not true for the original 6dof spring)
- Servo motor functionality
- Much more accurate bouncing. 0 really means zero bouncing (not true for the original 6odf) and there is only a minimal energy loss when the value is 1 (because of the solvers' precision)
- Rotation order for the Euler system can be set. (One axis' freedom is still limited to pi/2)

Cons:
- It is slower than the original 6dof. There is no exact ratio, but half speed is a good estimation.
- At bouncing the correct velocity is calculated, but not the correct position. (it is because of the solver can correct position or velocity, but not both.)

given (A,b,lo,hi), solve the LCP problem: A*x = b+w, where each x(i),w(i)
satisfies one of
	(1) x = lo, w >= 0
	(2) x = hi, w <= 0
	(3) lo < x < hi, w = 0
A is a matrix of dimension n*n, everything else is a vector of size n*1.
lo and hi can be +/- dInfinity as needed. the first `nub' variables are
unbounded, i.e. hi and lo are assumed to be +/- dInfinity.

we restrict lo(i) <= 0 and hi(i) >= 0.

the original data (A,b) may be modified by this function.

if the `findex' (friction index) parameter is nonzero, it points to an array
of index values. in this case constraints that have findex[i] >= 0 are
special. all non-special constraints are solved for, then the lo and hi values
for the special constraints are set:
  hi[i] = abs( hi[i] * x[findex[i]] )
  lo[i] = -hi[i]
and the solution continues. this mechanism allows a friction approximation
to be implemented. the first `nub' variables are assumed to have findex < 0.
