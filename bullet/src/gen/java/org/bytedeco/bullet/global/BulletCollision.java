/**
 * \mainpage Bullet Documentation
 *
 * \section intro_sec Introduction
 * Bullet is a Collision Detection and Rigid Body Dynamics Library. The Library is Open Source and free for commercial use, under the ZLib license ( http://opensource.org/licenses/zlib-license.php ).
 *
 * The main documentation is Bullet_User_Manual.pdf, included in the source code distribution.
 * There is the Physics Forum for feedback and general Collision Detection and Physics discussions.
 * Please visit http://www.bulletphysics.org
 *
 * \section install_sec Installation
 *
 * \subsection step1 Step 1: Download
 * You can download the Bullet Physics Library from the github repository: https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3/releases 
 *
 * \subsection step2 Step 2: Building
 * Bullet has multiple build systems, including premake, cmake and autotools. Premake and cmake support all platforms.
 * Premake is included in the Bullet/build folder for Windows, Mac OSX and Linux. 
 * Under Windows you can click on Bullet/build/vs2010.bat to create Microsoft Visual Studio projects. 
 * On Mac OSX and Linux you can open a terminal and generate Makefile, codeblocks or Xcode4 projects:
 * cd Bullet/build
 * ./premake4_osx gmake or ./premake4_linux gmake or ./premake4_linux64 gmake or (for Mac) ./premake4_osx xcode4
 * cd Bullet/build/gmake
 * make
 * 
 * An alternative to premake is cmake. You can download cmake from http://www.cmake.org
 * cmake can autogenerate projectfiles for Microsoft Visual Studio, Apple Xcode, KDevelop and Unix Makefiles.
 * The easiest is to run the CMake cmake-gui graphical user interface and choose the options and generate projectfiles.
 * You can also use cmake in the command-line. Here are some examples for various platforms:
 * cmake . -G "Visual Studio 9 2008"
 * cmake . -G Xcode
 * cmake . -G "Unix Makefiles"
 * Although cmake is recommended, you can also use autotools for UNIX: ./autogen.sh ./configure to create a Makefile and then run make.
 * 
 * \subsection step3 Step 3: Testing demos
 * Try to run and experiment with BasicDemo executable as a starting point.
 * Bullet can be used in several ways, as Full Rigid Body simulation, as Collision Detector Library or Low Level / Snippets like the GJK Closest Point calculation.
 * The Dependencies can be seen in this documentation under Directories
 * 
 * \subsection step4 Step 4: Integrating in your application, full Rigid Body and Soft Body simulation
 * Check out BasicDemo how to create a btDynamicsWorld, btRigidBody and btCollisionShape, Stepping the simulation and synchronizing your graphics object transform.
 * Check out SoftDemo how to use soft body dynamics, using btSoftRigidDynamicsWorld.
 * \subsection step5 Step 5 : Integrate the Collision Detection Library (without Dynamics and other Extras)
 * Bullet Collision Detection can also be used without the Dynamics/Extras.
 * Check out btCollisionWorld and btCollisionObject, and the CollisionInterfaceDemo.
 * \subsection step6 Step 6 : Use Snippets like the GJK Closest Point calculation.
 * Bullet has been designed in a modular way keeping dependencies to a minimum. The ConvexHullDistance demo demonstrates direct use of btGjkPairDetector.
 *
