/**
 * Note [Mt19937 Engine implementation]
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 * Originally implemented in:
 * http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MT2002/CODES/MTARCOK/mt19937ar-cok.c
 * and modified with C++ constructs. Moreover the state array of the engine
 * has been modified to hold 32 bit uints instead of 64 bits.
 *
 * Note that we reimplemented mt19937 instead of using std::mt19937 because,
 * at::mt19937 turns out to be faster in the pytorch codebase. PyTorch builds with -O2
 * by default and following are the benchmark numbers (benchmark code can be found at
 * https://github.com/syed-ahmed/benchmark-rngs):
 *
 * with -O2
 * Time to get 100000000 philox randoms with at::uniform_real_distribution = 0.462759s
 * Time to get 100000000 at::mt19937 randoms with at::uniform_real_distribution = 0.39628s
 * Time to get 100000000 std::mt19937 randoms with std::uniform_real_distribution = 0.352087s
 * Time to get 100000000 std::mt19937 randoms with at::uniform_real_distribution = 0.419454s
 *
 * std::mt19937 is faster when used in conjunction with std::uniform_real_distribution,
 * however we can't use std::uniform_real_distribution because of this bug:
 * http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/lwg-active.html#2524. Plus, even if we used
 * std::uniform_real_distribution and filtered out the 1's, it is a different algorithm
 * than what's in pytorch currently and that messes up the tests in tests_distributions.py.
 * The other option, using std::mt19937 with at::uniform_real_distribution is a tad bit slower
 * than at::mt19937 with at::uniform_real_distribution and hence, we went with the latter.
 *
 * Copyright notice:
 * A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/2/10.
 * Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.
 * This is a faster version by taking Shawn Cokus's optimization,
 * Matthe Bellew's simplification, Isaku Wada's real version.
 *
 * Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)
 * or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).
