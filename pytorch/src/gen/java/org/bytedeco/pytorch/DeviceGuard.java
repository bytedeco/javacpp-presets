/** RAII guard that sets a certain default device in its constructor, and
 *  changes it back to the device that was originally active upon destruction.
 * 
 *  The device is always reset to the one that was active at the time of
 *  construction of the guard. Even if you {@code set_device} after construction, the
 *  destructor will still reset the device to the one that was active at
 *  construction time.
 * 
 *  This device guard does NOT have an uninitialized state; it is guaranteed
 *  to reset a device on exit.  If you are in a situation where you *might*
 *  want to setup a guard (i.e., are looking for the moral equivalent
 *  of optional<DeviceGuard>), see OptionalDeviceGuard. */
