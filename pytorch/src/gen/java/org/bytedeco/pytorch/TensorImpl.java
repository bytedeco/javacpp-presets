/**
 * The low-level representation of a tensor, which contains a pointer
 * to a storage (which contains the actual data) and metadata (e.g., sizes and
 * strides) describing this particular view of the data as a tensor.
 *
 * Some basic characteristics about our in-memory representation of
 * tensors:
 *
 *  - It contains a pointer to a storage struct (Storage/StorageImpl)
 *    which contains the pointer to the actual data and records the
 *    data type and device of the view.  This allows multiple tensors
 *    to alias the same underlying data, which allows to efficiently
 *    implement differing *views* on a tensor.
 *
 *  - The tensor struct itself records view-specific metadata about
 *    the tensor, e.g., sizes, strides and offset into storage.
 *    Each view of a storage can have a different size or offset.
 *
 *  - This class is intrusively refcounted.  It is refcounted so that
 *    we can support prompt deallocation of large tensors; it is
 *    intrusively refcounted so that we can still perform reference
 *    counted operations on raw pointers, which is often more convenient
 *    when passing tensors across language boundaries.
 *
 *  - For backwards-compatibility reasons, a tensor may be in an
 *    uninitialized state.  A tensor may be uninitialized in the following
 *    two ways:
 *
 *      - A tensor may be DTYPE UNINITIALIZED.  A tensor of this
 *        form has an uninitialized dtype.  This situation most
 *        frequently arises when a user writes Tensor x(CPU).  The dtype and
 *        is subsequently initialized when mutable_data<T>() is
 *        invoked for the first time.
 *
 *      - A tensor may be STORAGE UNINITIALIZED.  A tensor of this form
 *        has non-zero size, but has a storage with a null data pointer.
 *        This situation most frequently arises when a user calls
 *        Resize() or FreeMemory().  This is because Caffe2 historically
 *        does lazy allocation: allocation of data doesn't occur until
 *        mutable_data<T>() is invoked.  A tensor with zero size is
 *        always storage initialized, because no allocation is necessary
 *        in this case.
 *
 *    All combinations of these two uninitialized states are possible.
 *    Consider the following transcript in idiomatic Caffe2 API:
 *
 *      Tensor x(CPU); // x is storage-initialized, dtype-UNINITIALIZED
 *      x.Resize(4); // x is storage-UNINITIALIZED, dtype-UNINITIALIZED
 *      x.mutable_data<float>(); // x is storage-initialized, dtype-initialized
 *      x.FreeMemory(); // x is storage-UNINITIALIZED, dtype-initialized.
 *
 *    All other fields on tensor are always initialized.  In particular,
 *    size is always valid. (Historically, a tensor declared as Tensor x(CPU)
 *    also had uninitialized size, encoded as numel == -1, but we have now
 *    decided to default to zero size, resulting in numel == 0).
 *
 *    Uninitialized storages MUST be uniquely owned, to keep our model
 *    simple.  Thus, we will reject operations which could cause an
 *    uninitialized storage to become shared (or a shared storage to
 *    become uninitialized, e.g., from FreeMemory).
 *
 *    In practice, tensors which are storage-UNINITIALIZED and
 *    dtype-UNINITIALIZED are *extremely* ephemeral: essentially,
 *    after you do a Resize(), you basically always call mutable_data()
 *    immediately afterwards.  Most functions are not designed to
 *    work if given a storage-UNINITIALIZED, dtype-UNINITIALIZED tensor.
 *
 *    We intend to eliminate all uninitialized states, so that every
 *    tensor is fully initialized in all fields.  Please do not write new code
 *    that depends on these uninitialized states.

  // NOTE [ TensorImpl Shallow-Copying ]
  //
  // TensorImpl shallow-copying is used when we want to have two Variables share
  // the same tensor metadata (e.g. sizes / strides / storage pointer /
  // storage_offset), but each with a different autograd history. Example call
  // sites:
  //
  // 1. `var_detached = var.detach()` uses `shallow_copy_and_detach()` to create
  // `var_detached` that shares the same tensor metadata with `var`, but with a
  // completely new autograd history.
  // 2. `var.set_data(tensor)` uses `shallow_copy_from()` to copy tensor
  // metadata from `tensor` into `var`, while keeping `var`'s original
  // AutogradMeta.
  //
  // Functions that shallow-copy a TensorImpl (such as
  // `shallow_copy_and_detach()` / `shallow_copy_from()` /
  // `copy_tensor_metadata()`) copy the tensor metadata fields (e.g. sizes /
  // strides / storage pointer / storage_offset) by value. However, the
  // following fields are not copied:
  //
  // 1. the AutogradMeta pointer, because it is unique for each Variable.
  // 2. the version counter, because the destination TensorImpl's version
  // counter is either set to the passed-in `version_counter` (in
  // `shallow_copy_and_detach()` and `copy_tensor_metadata()`), or it is kept
  // intact (in `shallow_copy_from()`). See NOTE [ Version Counter Sharing ] for
  // details.
  //
  // In `shallow_copy_and_detach()` and `copy_tensor_metadata()`, the passed-in
  // `allow_tensor_metadata_change` determines whether the TensorImpl
  // shallow-copy allows changes to its metadata (e.g. sizes / strides / storage
  // / storage_offset). See NOTE [ Metadata Change for a Detached Tensor ] for
  // details.
  //
  // In `shallow_copy_from()`, we don't check the destination TensorImpl's
  // `allow_tensor_metadata_change_`, because `shallow_copy_from()` is used for
  // implementing functions such as `var.set_data(tensor)`, which changes
  // `var`'s tensor metadata and expects its `allow_tensor_metadata_change_` to
  // be ignored.
