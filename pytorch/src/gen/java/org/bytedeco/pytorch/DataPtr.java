   * Compare the deleter in a DataPtr to expected_deleter.
   * If it matches, replace the deleter with new_deleter
   * and return true; otherwise, does nothing and returns
   * false.
   *
   * In general, it is not safe to unconditionally set the
   * deleter on a DataPtr, because you don't know what
   * the deleter is, and thus will have a hard time properly
   * disposing of the deleter without storing the original
   * deleter (this is difficult to do, because DeleterFnPtr
   * is not a closure, and because the context on DataPtr is
   * only a single word, you generally don't have enough
   * space to store both the original deleter and its context).
   * However, in some cases, you know /exactly/ what the deleter
   * is, and you have a new deleter that manually wraps
   * the old one.  In this case, you can safely swap the deleter
   * after asserting that the deleters line up.
   *
   * What are the requirements on new_deleter?  It must still
   * properly dispose of the void* pointer passed in as its argument,
   * where void* is whatever the context of the original deleter
   * is.  So in general, you expect the new deleter to look something
   * like this:
   *
   *      [](void* ptr) {
   *        some_new_stuff(ptr);
   *        get_orig_allocator()->raw_deleter(ptr);
   *      }
   *
   * Note that it won't work to close over the original
   * allocator; you don't have enough space to do that!  Also,
   * it's unsafe to assume that the passed in pointer in
   * question is the memory pointer in question; it might not
   * be; be sure to read the source code of the Allocator
   * in question to confirm this.
