     * Pain:  to prevent rare but fatal shutdown errors (issue 18808),
     * Thread.join() must wait for the join'ed thread's tstate to be unlinked
     * from the tstate chain.  That happens at the end of a thread's life,
     * in pystate.c.
     * The obvious way doesn't quite work:  create a lock which the tstate
     * unlinking code releases, and have Thread.join() wait to acquire that
     * lock.  The problem is that we _are_ at the end of the thread's life:
     * if the thread holds the last reference to the lock, decref'ing the
     * lock will delete the lock, and that may trigger arbitrary Python code
     * if there's a weakref, with a callback, to the lock.  But by this time
     * _PyRuntime.gilstate.tstate_current is already NULL, so only the simplest
     * of C code can be allowed to run (in particular it must not be possible to
     * release the GIL).
     * So instead of holding the lock directly, the tstate holds a weakref to
     * the lock:  that's the value of on_delete_data below.  Decref'ing a
     * weakref is harmless.
     * on_delete points to _threadmodule.c's static release_sentinel() function.
     * After the tstate is unlinked, release_sentinel is called with the
     * weakref-to-lock (on_delete_data) argument, and release_sentinel releases
     * the indirectly held lock.
