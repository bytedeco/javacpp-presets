// Arena allocator. Arena allocation replaces ordinary (heap-based) allocation
// with new/delete, and improves performance by aggregating allocations into
// larger blocks and freeing allocations all at once. Protocol messages are
// allocated on an arena by using Arena::CreateMessage<T>(Arena*), below, and
// are automatically freed when the arena is destroyed.
//
// This is a thread-safe implementation: multiple threads may allocate from the
// arena concurrently. Destruction is not thread-safe and the destructing
// thread must synchronize with users of the arena first.
//
// An arena provides two allocation interfaces: CreateMessage<T>, which works
// for arena-enabled proto2 message types as well as other types that satisfy
// the appropriate protocol (described below), and Create<T>, which works for
// any arbitrary type T. CreateMessage<T> is better when the type T supports it,
// because this interface (i) passes the arena pointer to the created object so
// that its sub-objects and internal allocations can use the arena too, and (ii)
// elides the object's destructor call when possible. Create<T> does not place
// any special requirements on the type T, and will invoke the object's
// destructor when the arena is destroyed.
//
// The arena message allocation protocol, required by CreateMessage<T>, is as
// follows:
//
// - The type T must have (at least) two constructors: a constructor with no
//   arguments, called when a T is allocated on the heap; and a constructor with
//   a Arena* argument, called when a T is allocated on an arena. If the
//   second constructor is called with a NULL arena pointer, it must be
//   equivalent to invoking the first (no-argument) constructor.
//
// - The type T must have a particular type trait: a nested type
//   |InternalArenaConstructable_|. This is usually a typedef to |void|. If no
//   such type trait exists, then the instantiation CreateMessage<T> will fail
//   to compile.
//
// - The type T *may* have the type trait |DestructorSkippable_|. If this type
//   trait is present in the type, then its destructor will not be called if and
//   only if it was passed a non-NULL arena pointer. If this type trait is not
//   present on the type, then its destructor is always called when the
//   containing arena is destroyed.
//
// - One- and two-user-argument forms of CreateMessage<T>() also exist that
//   forward these constructor arguments to T's constructor: for example,
//   CreateMessage<T>(Arena*, arg1, arg2) forwards to a constructor T(Arena*,
//   arg1, arg2).
//
// This protocol is implemented by all arena-enabled proto2 message classes as
// well as protobuf container types like RepeatedPtrField and Map. The protocol
// is internal to protobuf and is not guaranteed to be stable. Non-proto types
// should not rely on this protocol.

  // API to create any objects on the arena. Note that only the object will
  // be created on the arena; the underlying ptrs (in case of a proto2 message)
  // will be still heap allocated. Proto messages should usually be allocated
  // with CreateMessage<T>() instead.
  //
  // Note that even if T satisfies the arena message construction protocol
  // (InternalArenaConstructable_ trait and optional DestructorSkippable_
  // trait), as described above, this function does not follow the protocol;
  // instead, it treats T as a black-box type, just as if it did not have these
  // traits. Specifically, T's constructor arguments will always be only those
  // passed to Create<T>() -- no additional arena pointer is implicitly added.
  // Furthermore, the destructor will always be called at arena destruction time
  // (unless the destructor is trivial). Hence, from T's point of view, it is as
  // if the object were allocated on the heap (except that the underlying memory
  // is obtained from the arena).

  // (when compiled as C++11) that T is trivially default-constructible and
  // trivially destructible.
