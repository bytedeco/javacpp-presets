/**
 * \defgroup CINDEX_CODE_COMPLET Code completion
 *
 * Code completion involves taking an (incomplete) source file, along with
 * knowledge of where the user is actively editing that file, and suggesting
 * syntactically- and semantically-valid constructs that the user might want to
 * use at that particular point in the source code. These data structures and
 * routines provide support for code completion.

/**
 * A semantic string that describes a code-completion result.
 *
 * A semantic string that describes the formatting of a code-completion
 * result as a single "template" of text that should be inserted into the
 * source buffer when a particular code-completion result is selected.
 * Each semantic string is made up of some number of "chunks", each of which
 * contains some text along with a description of what that text means, e.g.,
 * the name of the entity being referenced, whether the text chunk is part of
 * the template, or whether it is a "placeholder" that the user should replace
 * with actual code,of a specific kind. See \c CXCompletionChunkKind for a
 * description of the different kinds of chunks.
