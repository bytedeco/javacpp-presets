/** \defgroup CINDEX libclang: C Interface to Clang
 *
 * The C Interface to Clang provides a relatively small API that exposes
 * facilities for parsing source code into an abstract syntax tree (AST),
 * loading already-parsed ASTs, traversing the AST, associating
 * physical source locations with elements within the AST, and other
 * facilities that support Clang-based development tools.
 *
 * This C interface to Clang will never provide all of the information
 * representation stored in Clang's C++ AST, nor should it: the intent is to
 * maintain an API that is relatively stable from one release to the next,
 * providing only the basic functionality needed to support development tools.
 *
 * To avoid namespace pollution, data types are prefixed with "CX" and
 * functions are prefixed with "clang_".
 *
