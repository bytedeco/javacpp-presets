JavaCPP presets for Flir's Spinnaker 
====================================

The [Spinnaker SDK](https://www.ptgrey.com/spinnaker-sdk) is FLIR's next generation GenICam3 API library built for machine vision developers. The [Spinnaker SDK](https://www.ptgrey.com/spinnaker-sdk) is compatible with Flir's/PointGrey's Oryx, Blackfly S, and all USB3 Vision camera models.

You can find demo illustrating use of the presets in the [JavaCV Examples](https://github.com/bytedeco/javacv-examples) project under `Spinnaker-demo` (initial development is on branch `spinnaker`).
