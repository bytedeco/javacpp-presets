/** Implement this class to get contact information. You can use these results for
 *  things like sounds and game logic. You can also get contact results by
 *  traversing the contact lists after the time step. However, you might miss
 *  some contacts because continuous physics leads to sub-stepping.
 *  Additionally you may receive multiple callbacks for the same contact in a
 *  single time step.
 *  You should strive to make your callbacks efficient because there may be
 *  many callbacks per time step.
 *  \warning You cannot create/destroy Box2D entities inside these callbacks. */
