/** A dynamic AABB tree broad-phase, inspired by Nathanael Presson's btDbvt.
 *  A dynamic tree arranges data in a binary tree to accelerate
 *  queries such as volume queries and ray casts. Leafs are proxies
 *  with an AABB. In the tree we expand the proxy AABB by b2_fatAABBFactor
 *  so that the proxy AABB is bigger than the client object. This allows the client
 *  object to move by small amounts without triggering a tree update.
 * 
 *  Nodes are pooled and relocatable, so we use node indices rather than pointers. */
