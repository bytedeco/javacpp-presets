    Creates an object ready to find the 3D pose of chilitags.
    <p>
    By default, Chilitags3D assumes an arbitrary, but reasonnable focal length
    (700), and expects the dimensions of the captured images. In this
    configuration, the depth estimation makes sense, but it is not accurate. In
    order to correctly estimate the 3D pose, the intrinsic calibration
    parameters of your camera needs to be provided. To do so, use the
    readCalibration() or setCalibration() methods.
    <p>
    Chilitags3D also assumes by default that the 3D pose of every detected tag
    is expected, and that every tag is independent from the others, and that
    they are 20 millimetres wide. The method read3DConfiguration() can be used
    to specify which tags are of interest, and how they are arranged on a rigid
    object, and how big they are.
    <p>
    To first detect th tags in the image, Chilitags3D creates a Chilitags
    instance, which can be accessed through the getChilitags() accessors. This
    Chilitags instance is set to have a persistence of 0, because Chilitags3D
    uses a more advanced Kalman filter. See enableFilter() and setPersistence()
    for more details.
    <p>
    You can also create yourself a separate instance of Chilitagsfor the 2D
    detection of tags and use it by calling
    Chilitags3D::estimate(const TagCornerMap &tags)
