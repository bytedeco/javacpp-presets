`flandmark` is a JVM wrapper for [flandmark library](https://github.com/uricamic/flandmark).

##Sources and Native Binaries
it is assumed that `flanddmark` sources can be found in `C:/flandmark/sources` and native binaries build in 
`C:/flandmark/build/$architecture}` for instance `C:/flandmark/build/x64` (similar convention as used by opencv).

Natiive binaries are build for `RelWithDebInfo`.
