/**
 * Register a user provided lock manager supporting the operations
 * specified by AVLockOp. The "mutex" argument to the function points
 * to a (void *) where the lockmgr should store/get a pointer to a user
 * allocated mutex. It is NULL upon AV_LOCK_CREATE and equal to the
 * value left by the last call for all other ops. If the lock manager is
 * unable to perform the op then it should leave the mutex in the same
 * state as when it was called and return a non-zero value. However,
 * when called with AV_LOCK_DESTROY the mutex will always be assumed to
 * have been successfully destroyed. If av_lockmgr_register succeeds
 * it will return a non-negative value, if it fails it will return a
 * negative value and destroy all mutex and unregister all callbacks.
 * av_lockmgr_register is not thread-safe, it must be called from a
 * single thread before any calls which make use of locking are used.
 *
 * @param cb User defined callback. av_lockmgr_register invokes calls
 *           to this callback and the previously registered callback.
 *           The callback will be used to create more than one mutex
 *           each of which must be backed by its own underlying locking
 *           mechanism (i.e. do not use a single static object to
 *           implement your lock manager). If cb is set to NULL the
 *           lockmgr will be unregistered.
 *
 * @deprecated This function does nothing, and always returns 0. Be sure to
 *             build with thread support to get basic thread safety.
