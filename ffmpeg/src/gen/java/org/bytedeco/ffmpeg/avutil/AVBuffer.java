/**
 * \defgroup lavu_buffer AVBuffer
 * \ingroup lavu_data
 *
 * \{
 * AVBuffer is an API for reference-counted data buffers.
 *
 * There are two core objects in this API -- AVBuffer and AVBufferRef. AVBuffer
 * represents the data buffer itself; it is opaque and not meant to be accessed
 * by the caller directly, but only through AVBufferRef. However, the caller may
 * e.g. compare two AVBuffer pointers to check whether two different references
 * are describing the same data buffer. AVBufferRef represents a single
 * reference to an AVBuffer and it is the object that may be manipulated by the
 * caller directly.
 *
 * There are two functions provided for creating a new AVBuffer with a single
 * reference -- av_buffer_alloc() to just allocate a new buffer, and
 * av_buffer_create() to wrap an existing array in an AVBuffer. From an existing
 * reference, additional references may be created with av_buffer_ref().
 * Use av_buffer_unref() to free a reference (this will automatically free the
 * data once all the references are freed).
 *
 * The convention throughout this API and the rest of FFmpeg is such that the
 * buffer is considered writable if there exists only one reference to it (and
 * it has not been marked as read-only). The av_buffer_is_writable() function is
 * provided to check whether this is true and av_buffer_make_writable() will
 * automatically create a new writable buffer when necessary.
 * Of course nothing prevents the calling code from violating this convention,
 * however that is safe only when all the existing references are under its
 * control.
 *
 * \note Referencing and unreferencing the buffers is thread-safe and thus
 * may be done from multiple threads simultaneously without any need for
 * additional locking.
 *
 * \note Two different references to the same buffer can point to different
 * parts of the buffer (i.e. their AVBufferRef.data will not be equal).
