        Since GMS works well when the number of features is large, we recommend to use the ORB feature and set FastThreshold to 0 to get as many as possible features quickly.
        If matching results are not satisfying, please add more features. (We use 10000 for images with 640 X 480).
        If your images have big rotation and scale changes, please set withRotation or withScale to true.
