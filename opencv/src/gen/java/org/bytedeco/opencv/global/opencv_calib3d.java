  \defgroup calib3d Camera Calibration and 3D Reconstruction
<p>
The functions in this section use a so-called pinhole camera model. The view of a scene
is obtained by projecting a scene's 3D point {@code P_w} into the image plane using a perspective
transformation which forms the corresponding pixel {@code p}. Both {@code P_w} and {@code p} are
represented in homogeneous coordinates, i.e. as 3D and 2D homogeneous vector respectively. You will
find a brief introduction to projective geometry, homogeneous vectors and homogeneous
transformations at the end of this section's introduction. For more succinct notation, we often drop
the 'homogeneous' and say vector instead of homogeneous vector.
<p>
The distortion-free projective transformation given by a  pinhole camera model is shown below.
<p>
<pre>{@code \[s \; p = A \begin{bmatrix} R|t \end{bmatrix} P_w,\]}</pre>
<p>
where {@code P_w} is a 3D point expressed with respect to the world coordinate system,
{@code p} is a 2D pixel in the image plane, {@code A} is the camera intrinsic matrix,
{@code R} and {@code t} are the rotation and translation that describe the change of coordinates from
world to camera coordinate systems (or camera frame) and {@code s} is the projective transformation's
arbitrary scaling and not part of the camera model.
<p>
The camera intrinsic matrix {@code A} (notation used as in \cite Zhang2000 and also generally notated
as {@code K}) projects 3D points given in the camera coordinate system to 2D pixel coordinates, i.e.
<p>
<pre>{@code \[p = A P_c.\]}</pre>
<p>
The camera intrinsic matrix {@code A} is composed of the focal lengths {@code f_x} and {@code f_y}, which are
expressed in pixel units, and the principal point {@code (c_x, c_y)}, that is usually close to the
image center:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[A = \vecthreethree{f_x}{0}{c_x}{0}{f_y}{c_y}{0}{0}{1},\]}</pre>
<p>
and thus
<p>
<pre>{@code \[s \vecthree{u}{v}{1} = \vecthreethree{f_x}{0}{c_x}{0}{f_y}{c_y}{0}{0}{1} \vecthree{X_c}{Y_c}{Z_c}.\]}</pre>
<p>
The matrix of intrinsic parameters does not depend on the scene viewed. So, once estimated, it can
be re-used as long as the focal length is fixed (in case of a zoom lens). Thus, if an image from the
camera is scaled by a factor, all of these parameters need to be scaled (multiplied/divided,
respectively) by the same factor.
<p>
The joint rotation-translation matrix {@code [R|t]} is the matrix product of a projective
transformation and a homogeneous transformation. The 3-by-4 projective transformation maps 3D points
represented in camera coordinates to 2D points in the image plane and represented in normalized
camera coordinates {@code x' = X_c / Z_c} and {@code y' = Y_c / Z_c}:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[Z_c \begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
y' \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X_c \\
Y_c \\
Z_c \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\]}</pre>
<p>
The homogeneous transformation is encoded by the extrinsic parameters {@code R} and {@code t} and
represents the change of basis from world coordinate system {@code w} to the camera coordinate sytem
{@code c}. Thus, given the representation of the point {@code P} in world coordinates, {@code P_w}, we
obtain {@code P}'s representation in the camera coordinate system, {@code P_c}, by
<p>
<pre>{@code \[P_c = \begin{bmatrix}
R & t \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} P_w,\]}</pre>
<p>
This homogeneous transformation is composed out of {@code R}, a 3-by-3 rotation matrix, and {@code t}, a
3-by-1 translation vector:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[\begin{bmatrix}
R & t \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix},
\]}</pre>
<p>
and therefore
<p>
<pre>{@code \[\begin{bmatrix}
X_c \\
Y_c \\
Z_c \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\]}</pre>
<p>
Combining the projective transformation and the homogeneous transformation, we obtain the projective
transformation that maps 3D points in world coordinates into 2D points in the image plane and in
normalized camera coordinates:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[Z_c \begin{bmatrix}
x' \\
y' \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} R|t \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix},\]}</pre>
<p>
with {@code x' = X_c / Z_c} and {@code y' = Y_c / Z_c}. Putting the equations for instrincs and extrinsics together, we can write out
{@code s \; p = A \begin{bmatrix} R|t \end{bmatrix} P_w} as
<p>
<pre>{@code \[s \vecthree{u}{v}{1} = \vecthreethree{f_x}{0}{c_x}{0}{f_y}{c_y}{0}{0}{1}
\begin{bmatrix}
r_{11} & r_{12} & r_{13} & t_x \\
r_{21} & r_{22} & r_{23} & t_y \\
r_{31} & r_{32} & r_{33} & t_z
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\]}</pre>
<p>
If {@code Z_c \ne 0}, the transformation above is equivalent to the following,
<p>
<pre>{@code \[\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
f_x X_c/Z_c + c_x \\
f_y Y_c/Z_c + c_y
\end{bmatrix}\]}</pre>
<p>
with
<p>
<pre>{@code \[\vecthree{X_c}{Y_c}{Z_c} = \begin{bmatrix}
R|t
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
X_w \\
Y_w \\
Z_w \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\]}</pre>
<p>
The following figure illustrates the pinhole camera model.
<p>
![Pinhole camera model](pics/pinhole_camera_model.png)
<p>
Real lenses usually have some distortion, mostly radial distortion, and slight tangential distortion.
So, the above model is extended as:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
f_x x'' + c_x \\
f_y y'' + c_y
\end{bmatrix}\]}</pre>
<p>
where
<p>
<pre>{@code \[\begin{bmatrix}
x'' \\
y''
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
x' \frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6} + 2 p_1 x' y' + p_2(r^2 + 2 x'^2) + s_1 r^2 + s_2 r^4 \\
y' \frac{1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6}{1 + k_4 r^2 + k_5 r^4 + k_6 r^6} + p_1 (r^2 + 2 y'^2) + 2 p_2 x' y' + s_3 r^2 + s_4 r^4 \\
\end{bmatrix}\]}</pre>
<p>
with
<p>
<pre>{@code \[r^2 = x'^2 + y'^2\]}</pre>
<p>
and
<p>
<pre>{@code \[\begin{bmatrix}
x'\\
y'
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
X_c/Z_c \\
Y_c/Z_c
\end{bmatrix},\]}</pre>
<p>
if {@code Z_c \ne 0}.
<p>
The distortion parameters are the radial coefficients {@code k_1}, {@code k_2}, {@code k_3}, {@code k_4}, {@code k_5}, and {@code k_6}
,{@code p_1} and {@code p_2} are the tangential distortion coefficients, and {@code s_1}, {@code s_2}, {@code s_3}, and {@code s_4},
are the thin prism distortion coefficients. Higher-order coefficients are not considered in OpenCV.
<p>
The next figures show two common types of radial distortion: barrel distortion
({@code  1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6 } monotonically decreasing)
and pincushion distortion ({@code  1 + k_1 r^2 + k_2 r^4 + k_3 r^6 } monotonically increasing).
Radial distortion is always monotonic for real lenses,
and if the estimator produces a non-monotonic result,
this should be considered a calibration failure.
More generally, radial distortion must be monotonic and the distortion function must be bijective.
A failed estimation result may look deceptively good near the image center
but will work poorly in e.g. AR/SFM applications.
The optimization method used in OpenCV camera calibration does not include these constraints as
the framework does not support the required integer programming and polynomial inequalities.
See [issue #15992](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/15992) for additional information.
<p>
![](pics/distortion_examples.png)
![](pics/distortion_examples2.png)
<p>
In some cases, the image sensor may be tilted in order to focus an oblique plane in front of the
camera (Scheimpflug principle). This can be useful for particle image velocimetry (PIV) or
triangulation with a laser fan. The tilt causes a perspective distortion of {@code x''} and
{@code y''}. This distortion can be modeled in the following way, see e.g. \cite Louhichi07.
<p>
<pre>{@code \[\begin{bmatrix}
u \\
v
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
f_x x''' + c_x \\
f_y y''' + c_y
\end{bmatrix},\]}</pre>
<p>
where
<p>
<pre>{@code \[s\vecthree{x'''}{y'''}{1} =
\vecthreethree{R_{33}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}{0}{-R_{13}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}
{0}{R_{33}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}{-R_{23}(\tau_x, \tau_y)}
{0}{0}{1} R(\tau_x, \tau_y) \vecthree{x''}{y''}{1}\]}</pre>
<p>
and the matrix {@code R(\tau_x, \tau_y)} is defined by two rotations with angular parameter
{@code \tau_x} and {@code \tau_y}, respectively,
<p>
<pre>{@code \[
R(\tau_x, \tau_y) =
\vecthreethree{\cos(\tau_y)}{0}{-\sin(\tau_y)}{0}{1}{0}{\sin(\tau_y)}{0}{\cos(\tau_y)}
\vecthreethree{1}{0}{0}{0}{\cos(\tau_x)}{\sin(\tau_x)}{0}{-\sin(\tau_x)}{\cos(\tau_x)} =
\vecthreethree{\cos(\tau_y)}{\sin(\tau_y)\sin(\tau_x)}{-\sin(\tau_y)\cos(\tau_x)}
{0}{\cos(\tau_x)}{\sin(\tau_x)}
{\sin(\tau_y)}{-\cos(\tau_y)\sin(\tau_x)}{\cos(\tau_y)\cos(\tau_x)}.
\]}</pre>
<p>
In the functions below the coefficients are passed or returned as
<p>
<pre>{@code \[(k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3[, k_4, k_5, k_6 [, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4[, \tau_x, \tau_y]]]])\]}</pre>
<p>
vector. That is, if the vector contains four elements, it means that {@code k_3=0} . The distortion
coefficients do not depend on the scene viewed. Thus, they also belong to the intrinsic camera
parameters. And they remain the same regardless of the captured image resolution. If, for example, a
camera has been calibrated on images of 320 x 240 resolution, absolutely the same distortion
coefficients can be used for 640 x 480 images from the same camera while {@code f_x}, {@code f_y},
{@code c_x}, and {@code c_y} need to be scaled appropriately.
<p>
The functions below use the above model to do the following:
<p>
-   Project 3D points to the image plane given intrinsic and extrinsic parameters.
-   Compute extrinsic parameters given intrinsic parameters, a few 3D points, and their
projections.
-   Estimate intrinsic and extrinsic camera parameters from several views of a known calibration
pattern (every view is described by several 3D-2D point correspondences).
-   Estimate the relative position and orientation of the stereo camera "heads" and compute the
*rectification* transformation that makes the camera optical axes parallel.
<p>
<B> Homogeneous Coordinates </B><br>
Homogeneous Coordinates are a system of coordinates that are used in projective geometry. Their use
allows to represent points at infinity by finite coordinates and simplifies formulas when compared
to the cartesian counterparts, e.g. they have the advantage that affine transformations can be
expressed as linear homogeneous transformation.
<p>
One obtains the homogeneous vector {@code P_h} by appending a 1 along an n-dimensional cartesian
vector {@code P} e.g. for a 3D cartesian vector the mapping {@code P \rightarrow P_h} is:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z
\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\]}</pre>
<p>
For the inverse mapping {@code P_h \rightarrow P}, one divides all elements of the homogeneous vector
by its last element, e.g. for a 3D homogeneous vector one gets its 2D cartesian counterpart by:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
W
\end{bmatrix} \rightarrow \begin{bmatrix}
X / W \\
Y / W
\end{bmatrix},\]}</pre>
<p>
if {@code W \ne 0}.
<p>
Due to this mapping, all multiples {@code k P_h}, for {@code k \ne 0}, of a homogeneous point represent
the same point {@code P_h}. An intuitive understanding of this property is that under a projective
transformation, all multiples of {@code P_h} are mapped to the same point. This is the physical
observation one does for pinhole cameras, as all points along a ray through the camera's pinhole are
projected to the same image point, e.g. all points along the red ray in the image of the pinhole
camera model above would be mapped to the same image coordinate. This property is also the source
for the scale ambiguity s in the equation of the pinhole camera model.
<p>
As mentioned, by using homogeneous coordinates we can express any change of basis parameterized by
{@code R} and {@code t} as a linear transformation, e.g. for the change of basis from coordinate system
0 to coordinate system 1 becomes:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[P_1 = R P_0 + t \rightarrow P_{h_1} = \begin{bmatrix}
R & t \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} P_{h_0}.\]}</pre>
<p>
\note
    -   Many functions in this module take a camera intrinsic matrix as an input parameter. Although all
        functions assume the same structure of this parameter, they may name it differently. The
        parameter's description, however, will be clear in that a camera intrinsic matrix with the structure
        shown above is required.

A rotation vector is a convenient and most compact representation of a rotation matrix (since any
rotation matrix has just 3 degrees of freedom). The representation is used in the global 3D geometry
optimization procedures like \ref calibrateCamera, \ref stereoCalibrate, or \ref solvePnP .

/** \brief Finds a perspective transformation between two planes.
<p>
@param srcPoints Coordinates of the points in the original plane, a matrix of the type CV_32FC2
or vector\<Point2f\> .
@param dstPoints Coordinates of the points in the target plane, a matrix of the type CV_32FC2 or
a vector\<Point2f\> .
@param method Method used to compute a homography matrix. The following methods are possible:
-   **0** - a regular method using all the points, i.e., the least squares method
-   \ref RANSAC - RANSAC-based robust method
-   \ref LMEDS - Least-Median robust method
-   \ref RHO - PROSAC-based robust method
@param ransacReprojThreshold Maximum allowed reprojection error to treat a point pair as an inlier
(used in the RANSAC and RHO methods only). That is, if
<pre>{@code \[\| \texttt{dstPoints} _i -  \texttt{convertPointsHomogeneous} ( \texttt{H} \cdot \texttt{srcPoints} _i) \|_2  >  \texttt{ransacReprojThreshold}\]}</pre>
then the point {@code i} is considered as an outlier. If srcPoints and dstPoints are measured in pixels,
it usually makes sense to set this parameter somewhere in the range of 1 to 10.
@param mask Optional output mask set by a robust method ( RANSAC or LMeDS ). Note that the input
mask values are ignored.
@param maxIters The maximum number of RANSAC iterations.
@param confidence Confidence level, between 0 and 1.
<p>
The function finds and returns the perspective transformation {@code H} between the source and the
destination planes:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[s_i  \vecthree{x'_i}{y'_i}{1} \sim H  \vecthree{x_i}{y_i}{1}\]}</pre>
<p>
so that the back-projection error
<p>
<pre>{@code \[\sum _i \left ( x'_i- \frac{h_{11} x_i + h_{12} y_i + h_{13}}{h_{31} x_i + h_{32} y_i + h_{33}} \right )^2+ \left ( y'_i- \frac{h_{21} x_i + h_{22} y_i + h_{23}}{h_{31} x_i + h_{32} y_i + h_{33}} \right )^2\]}</pre>
<p>
is minimized. If the parameter method is set to the default value 0, the function uses all the point
pairs to compute an initial homography estimate with a simple least-squares scheme.
<p>
However, if not all of the point pairs ( {@code srcPoints_i}, {@code dstPoints_i} ) fit the rigid perspective
transformation (that is, there are some outliers), this initial estimate will be poor. In this case,
you can use one of the three robust methods. The methods RANSAC, LMeDS and RHO try many different
random subsets of the corresponding point pairs (of four pairs each, collinear pairs are discarded), estimate the homography matrix
using this subset and a simple least-squares algorithm, and then compute the quality/goodness of the
computed homography (which is the number of inliers for RANSAC or the least median re-projection error for
LMeDS). The best subset is then used to produce the initial estimate of the homography matrix and
the mask of inliers/outliers.
<p>
Regardless of the method, robust or not, the computed homography matrix is refined further (using
inliers only in case of a robust method) with the Levenberg-Marquardt method to reduce the
re-projection error even more.
<p>
The methods RANSAC and RHO can handle practically any ratio of outliers but need a threshold to
distinguish inliers from outliers. The method LMeDS does not need any threshold but it works
correctly only when there are more than 50% of inliers. Finally, if there are no outliers and the
noise is rather small, use the default method (method=0).
<p>
The function is used to find initial intrinsic and extrinsic matrices. Homography matrix is
determined up to a scale. Thus, it is normalized so that {@code h_{33}=1}. Note that whenever an {@code H} matrix
cannot be estimated, an empty one will be returned.

@param rotMatrixY Optional 3x3 rotation matrix around y-axis.
@param rotMatrixZ Optional 3x3 rotation matrix around z-axis.
@param eulerAngles Optional three-element vector containing three Euler angles of rotation in
degrees.
<p>
The function computes a decomposition of a projection matrix into a calibration and a rotation
matrix and the position of a camera.
<p>
It optionally returns three rotation matrices, one for each axis, and three Euler angles that could
be used in OpenGL. Note, there is always more than one sequence of rotations about the three
principal axes that results in the same orientation of an object, e.g. see \cite Slabaugh . Returned
three rotation matrices and corresponding three Euler angles are only one of the possible solutions.
<p>
The function is based on #RQDecomp3x3 .

@param imagePoints Output array of image points, 1xN/Nx1 2-channel, or

@param jacobian Optional output 2Nx(10+\<numDistCoeffs\>) jacobian matrix of derivatives of image

coordinates of the principal point and the distortion coefficients. In the old interface different
components of the jacobian are returned via different output parameters.
@param aspectRatio Optional "fixed aspect ratio" parameter. If the parameter is not 0, the
function assumes that the aspect ratio ({@code f_x / f_y}) is fixed and correspondingly adjusts the
jacobian matrix.
<p>
The function computes the 2D projections of 3D points to the image plane, given intrinsic and
extrinsic camera parameters. Optionally, the function computes Jacobians -matrices of partial
derivatives of image points coordinates (as functions of all the input parameters) with respect to
the particular parameters, intrinsic and/or extrinsic. The Jacobians are used during the global
optimization in \ref calibrateCamera, \ref solvePnP, and \ref stereoCalibrate. The function itself
can also be used to compute a re-projection error, given the current intrinsic and extrinsic
parameters.
<p>
\note By setting rvec = tvec = {@code [0, 0, 0]}, or by setting cameraMatrix to a 3x3 identity matrix,
or by passing zero distortion coefficients, one can get various useful partial cases of the
function. This means, one can compute the distorted coordinates for a sparse set of points or apply
a perspective transformation (and also compute the derivatives) in the ideal zero-distortion setup.

/** \brief Finds an object pose from 3D-2D point correspondences.
<p>
@see \ref calib3d_solvePnP
<p>
This function returns the rotation and the translation vectors that transform a 3D point expressed in the object
coordinate frame to the camera coordinate frame, using different methods:
- P3P methods (\ref SOLVEPNP_P3P, \ref SOLVEPNP_AP3P): need 4 input points to return a unique solution.
- \ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE Input points must be >= 4 and object points must be coplanar.
- \ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE Special case suitable for marker pose estimation.
Number of input points must be 4. Object points must be defined in the following order:
  - point 0: [-squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
  - point 1: [ squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
  - point 2: [ squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
  - point 3: [-squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
- for all the other flags, number of input points must be >= 4 and object points can be in any configuration.
<p>
@param objectPoints Array of object points in the object coordinate space, Nx3 1-channel or
1xN/Nx1 3-channel, where N is the number of points. vector\<Point3d\> can be also passed here.
@param imagePoints Array of corresponding image points, Nx2 1-channel or 1xN/Nx1 2-channel,
where N is the number of points. vector\<Point2d\> can be also passed here.
@param cameraMatrix Input camera intrinsic matrix {@code \cameramatrix{A}} .
@param distCoeffs Input vector of distortion coefficients
{@code \distcoeffs}. If the vector is NULL/empty, the zero distortion coefficients are
assumed.
@param rvec Output rotation vector (see \ref Rodrigues ) that, together with tvec, brings points from
the model coordinate system to the camera coordinate system.
@param tvec Output translation vector.
@param useExtrinsicGuess Parameter used for #SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE. If true (1), the function uses
the provided rvec and tvec values as initial approximations of the rotation and translation
vectors, respectively, and further optimizes them.
@param flags Method for solving a PnP problem: see \ref calib3d_solvePnP_flags
<p>
More information about Perspective-n-Points is described in \ref calib3d_solvePnP
<p>
\note
   -   An example of how to use solvePnP for planar augmented reality can be found at
        opencv_source_code/samples/python/plane_ar.py
   -   If you are using Python:
        - Numpy array slices won't work as input because solvePnP requires contiguous
        arrays (enforced by the assertion using cv::Mat::checkVector() around line 55 of
        modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
        - The P3P algorithm requires image points to be in an array of shape (N,1,2) due
        to its calling of #undistortPoints (around line 75 of modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
        which requires 2-channel information.
        - Thus, given some data D = np.array(...) where D.shape = (N,M), in order to use a subset of
        it as, e.g., imagePoints, one must effectively copy it into a new array: imagePoints =
        np.ascontiguousarray(D[:,:2]).reshape((N,1,2))
   -   The methods \ref SOLVEPNP_DLS and \ref SOLVEPNP_UPNP cannot be used as the current implementations are
       unstable and sometimes give completely wrong results. If you pass one of these two
       flags, \ref SOLVEPNP_EPNP method will be used instead.
   -   The minimum number of points is 4 in the general case. In the case of \ref SOLVEPNP_P3P and \ref SOLVEPNP_AP3P
       methods, it is required to use exactly 4 points (the first 3 points are used to estimate all the solutions
       of the P3P problem, the last one is used to retain the best solution that minimizes the reprojection error).
   -   With \ref SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE method and {@code useExtrinsicGuess=true}, the minimum number of points is 3 (3 points
       are sufficient to compute a pose but there are up to 4 solutions). The initial solution should be close to the
       global solution to converge.
   -   With \ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE input points must be >= 4 and object points must be coplanar.
   -   With \ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE this is a special case suitable for marker pose estimation.
       Number of input points must be 4. Object points must be defined in the following order:
         - point 0: [-squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
         - point 1: [ squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
         - point 2: [ squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
         - point 3: [-squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
    -  With \ref SOLVEPNP_SQPNP input points must be >= 3

/** \brief Finds an object pose from 3D-2D point correspondences using the RANSAC scheme.
<p>
@see \ref calib3d_solvePnP
<p>
@param objectPoints Array of object points in the object coordinate space, Nx3 1-channel or
1xN/Nx1 3-channel, where N is the number of points. vector\<Point3d\> can be also passed here.
@param imagePoints Array of corresponding image points, Nx2 1-channel or 1xN/Nx1 2-channel,
where N is the number of points. vector\<Point2d\> can be also passed here.
@param cameraMatrix Input camera intrinsic matrix {@code \cameramatrix{A}} .
@param distCoeffs Input vector of distortion coefficients
{@code \distcoeffs}. If the vector is NULL/empty, the zero distortion coefficients are
assumed.
@param rvec Output rotation vector (see \ref Rodrigues ) that, together with tvec, brings points from
the model coordinate system to the camera coordinate system.
@param tvec Output translation vector.
@param useExtrinsicGuess Parameter used for \ref SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE. If true (1), the function uses
the provided rvec and tvec values as initial approximations of the rotation and translation
vectors, respectively, and further optimizes them.
@param iterationsCount Number of iterations.
@param reprojectionError Inlier threshold value used by the RANSAC procedure. The parameter value
is the maximum allowed distance between the observed and computed point projections to consider it
an inlier.
@param confidence The probability that the algorithm produces a useful result.
@param inliers Output vector that contains indices of inliers in objectPoints and imagePoints .
@param flags Method for solving a PnP problem (see \ref solvePnP ).
<p>
The function estimates an object pose given a set of object points, their corresponding image
projections, as well as the camera intrinsic matrix and the distortion coefficients. This function finds such
a pose that minimizes reprojection error, that is, the sum of squared distances between the observed
projections imagePoints and the projected (using \ref projectPoints ) objectPoints. The use of RANSAC
makes the function resistant to outliers.
<p>
\note
   -   An example of how to use solvePNPRansac for object detection can be found at
        opencv_source_code/samples/cpp/tutorial_code/calib3d/real_time_pose_estimation/
   -   The default method used to estimate the camera pose for the Minimal Sample Sets step
       is #SOLVEPNP_EPNP. Exceptions are:
         - if you choose #SOLVEPNP_P3P or #SOLVEPNP_AP3P, these methods will be used.
         - if the number of input points is equal to 4, #SOLVEPNP_P3P is used.
   -   The method used to estimate the camera pose using all the inliers is defined by the
       flags parameters unless it is equal to #SOLVEPNP_P3P or #SOLVEPNP_AP3P. In this case,
       the method #SOLVEPNP_EPNP will be used instead.

/** \brief Finds an object pose from 3D-2D point correspondences.
<p>
@see \ref calib3d_solvePnP
<p>
This function returns a list of all the possible solutions (a solution is a <rotation vector, translation vector>
couple), depending on the number of input points and the chosen method:
- P3P methods (\ref SOLVEPNP_P3P, \ref SOLVEPNP_AP3P): 3 or 4 input points. Number of returned solutions can be between 0 and 4 with 3 input points.
- \ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE Input points must be >= 4 and object points must be coplanar. Returns 2 solutions.
- \ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE Special case suitable for marker pose estimation.
Number of input points must be 4 and 2 solutions are returned. Object points must be defined in the following order:
  - point 0: [-squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
  - point 1: [ squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
  - point 2: [ squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
  - point 3: [-squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
- for all the other flags, number of input points must be >= 4 and object points can be in any configuration.
Only 1 solution is returned.
<p>
@param objectPoints Array of object points in the object coordinate space, Nx3 1-channel or
1xN/Nx1 3-channel, where N is the number of points. vector\<Point3d\> can be also passed here.
@param imagePoints Array of corresponding image points, Nx2 1-channel or 1xN/Nx1 2-channel,
where N is the number of points. vector\<Point2d\> can be also passed here.
@param cameraMatrix Input camera intrinsic matrix {@code \cameramatrix{A}} .
@param distCoeffs Input vector of distortion coefficients
{@code \distcoeffs}. If the vector is NULL/empty, the zero distortion coefficients are
assumed.
@param rvecs Vector of output rotation vectors (see \ref Rodrigues ) that, together with tvecs, brings points from
the model coordinate system to the camera coordinate system.
@param tvecs Vector of output translation vectors.
@param useExtrinsicGuess Parameter used for #SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE. If true (1), the function uses
the provided rvec and tvec values as initial approximations of the rotation and translation
vectors, respectively, and further optimizes them.
@param flags Method for solving a PnP problem: see \ref calib3d_solvePnP_flags
@param rvec Rotation vector used to initialize an iterative PnP refinement algorithm, when flag is \ref SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE
and useExtrinsicGuess is set to true.
@param tvec Translation vector used to initialize an iterative PnP refinement algorithm, when flag is \ref SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE
and useExtrinsicGuess is set to true.
@param reprojectionError Optional vector of reprojection error, that is the RMS error
({@code  \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i}^{N} \left ( \hat{y_i} - y_i \right )^2}{N}} }) between the input image points
and the 3D object points projected with the estimated pose.
<p>
More information is described in \ref calib3d_solvePnP
<p>
\note
   -   An example of how to use solvePnP for planar augmented reality can be found at
        opencv_source_code/samples/python/plane_ar.py
   -   If you are using Python:
        - Numpy array slices won't work as input because solvePnP requires contiguous
        arrays (enforced by the assertion using cv::Mat::checkVector() around line 55 of
        modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
        - The P3P algorithm requires image points to be in an array of shape (N,1,2) due
        to its calling of #undistortPoints (around line 75 of modules/calib3d/src/solvepnp.cpp version 2.4.9)
        which requires 2-channel information.
        - Thus, given some data D = np.array(...) where D.shape = (N,M), in order to use a subset of
        it as, e.g., imagePoints, one must effectively copy it into a new array: imagePoints =
        np.ascontiguousarray(D[:,:2]).reshape((N,1,2))
   -   The methods \ref SOLVEPNP_DLS and \ref SOLVEPNP_UPNP cannot be used as the current implementations are
       unstable and sometimes give completely wrong results. If you pass one of these two
       flags, \ref SOLVEPNP_EPNP method will be used instead.
   -   The minimum number of points is 4 in the general case. In the case of \ref SOLVEPNP_P3P and \ref SOLVEPNP_AP3P
       methods, it is required to use exactly 4 points (the first 3 points are used to estimate all the solutions
       of the P3P problem, the last one is used to retain the best solution that minimizes the reprojection error).
   -   With \ref SOLVEPNP_ITERATIVE method and {@code useExtrinsicGuess=true}, the minimum number of points is 3 (3 points
       are sufficient to compute a pose but there are up to 4 solutions). The initial solution should be close to the
       global solution to converge.
   -   With \ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE input points must be >= 4 and object points must be coplanar.
   -   With \ref SOLVEPNP_IPPE_SQUARE this is a special case suitable for marker pose estimation.
       Number of input points must be 4. Object points must be defined in the following order:
         - point 0: [-squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
         - point 1: [ squareLength / 2,  squareLength / 2, 0]
         - point 2: [ squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]
         - point 3: [-squareLength / 2, -squareLength / 2, 0]

/** \brief Finds the positions of internal corners of the chessboard.
<p>
@param image Source chessboard view. It must be an 8-bit grayscale or color image.
@param patternSize Number of inner corners per a chessboard row and column
( patternSize = cv::Size(points_per_row,points_per_colum) = cv::Size(columns,rows) ).
@param corners Output array of detected corners.
@param flags Various operation flags that can be zero or a combination of the following values:
-   \ref CALIB_CB_ADAPTIVE_THRESH Use adaptive thresholding to convert the image to black
and white, rather than a fixed threshold level (computed from the average image brightness).
-   \ref CALIB_CB_NORMALIZE_IMAGE Normalize the image gamma with #equalizeHist before
applying fixed or adaptive thresholding.
-   \ref CALIB_CB_FILTER_QUADS Use additional criteria (like contour area, perimeter,
square-like shape) to filter out false quads extracted at the contour retrieval stage.
-   \ref CALIB_CB_FAST_CHECK Run a fast check on the image that looks for chessboard corners,
and shortcut the call if none is found. This can drastically speed up the call in the
degenerate condition when no chessboard is observed.
-   \ref CALIB_CB_PLAIN All other flags are ignored. The input image is taken as is.
No image processing is done to improve to find the checkerboard. This has the effect of speeding up the
execution of the function but could lead to not recognizing the checkerboard if the image
is not previously binarized in the appropriate manner.
<p>
The function attempts to determine whether the input image is a view of the chessboard pattern and
locate the internal chessboard corners. The function returns a non-zero value if all of the corners
are found and they are placed in a certain order (row by row, left to right in every row).
Otherwise, if the function fails to find all the corners or reorder them, it returns 0. For example,
a regular chessboard has 8 x 8 squares and 7 x 7 internal corners, that is, points where the black
squares touch each other. The detected coordinates are approximate, and to determine their positions
more accurately, the function calls #cornerSubPix. You also may use the function #cornerSubPix with
different parameters if returned coordinates are not accurate enough.
<p>
Sample usage of detecting and drawing chessboard corners: :
<pre>{@code
    Size patternsize(8,6); //interior number of corners
    Mat gray = ....; //source image
    vector<Point2f> corners; //this will be filled by the detected corners

    //CALIB_CB_FAST_CHECK saves a lot of time on images
    //that do not contain any chessboard corners
    bool patternfound = findChessboardCorners(gray, patternsize, corners,
            CALIB_CB_ADAPTIVE_THRESH + CALIB_CB_NORMALIZE_IMAGE

/** \brief Finds the positions of internal corners of the chessboard using a sector based approach.
<p>
@param image Source chessboard view. It must be an 8-bit grayscale or color image.
@param patternSize Number of inner corners per a chessboard row and column
( patternSize = cv::Size(points_per_row,points_per_colum) = cv::Size(columns,rows) ).
@param corners Output array of detected corners.
@param flags Various operation flags that can be zero or a combination of the following values:
-   \ref CALIB_CB_NORMALIZE_IMAGE Normalize the image gamma with equalizeHist before detection.
-   \ref CALIB_CB_EXHAUSTIVE Run an exhaustive search to improve detection rate.
-   \ref CALIB_CB_ACCURACY Up sample input image to improve sub-pixel accuracy due to aliasing effects.
-   \ref CALIB_CB_LARGER The detected pattern is allowed to be larger than patternSize (see description).
-   \ref CALIB_CB_MARKER The detected pattern must have a marker (see description).
This should be used if an accurate camera calibration is required.
@param meta Optional output arrray of detected corners (CV_8UC1 and size = cv::Size(columns,rows)).
Each entry stands for one corner of the pattern and can have one of the following values:
-   0 = no meta data attached
-   1 = left-top corner of a black cell
-   2 = left-top corner of a white cell
-   3 = left-top corner of a black cell with a white marker dot
-   4 = left-top corner of a white cell with a black marker dot (pattern origin in case of markers otherwise first corner)
<p>
The function is analog to #findChessboardCorners but uses a localized radon
transformation approximated by box filters being more robust to all sort of
noise, faster on larger images and is able to directly return the sub-pixel
position of the internal chessboard corners. The Method is based on the paper
\cite duda2018 "Accurate Detection and Localization of Checkerboard Corners for
Calibration" demonstrating that the returned sub-pixel positions are more
accurate than the one returned by cornerSubPix allowing a precise camera
calibration for demanding applications.
<p>
In the case, the flags \ref CALIB_CB_LARGER or \ref CALIB_CB_MARKER are given,
the result can be recovered from the optional meta array. Both flags are
helpful to use calibration patterns exceeding the field of view of the camera.
These oversized patterns allow more accurate calibrations as corners can be
utilized, which are as close as possible to the image borders.  For a
consistent coordinate system across all images, the optional marker (see image
below) can be used to move the origin of the board to the location where the
black circle is located.
<p>
\note The function requires a white boarder with roughly the same width as one
of the checkerboard fields around the whole board to improve the detection in
various environments. In addition, because of the localized radon
transformation it is beneficial to use round corners for the field corners
which are located on the outside of the board. The following figure illustrates
a sample checkerboard optimized for the detection. However, any other checkerboard
can be used as well.

/** \brief Estimates the sharpness of a detected chessboard.
<p>
Image sharpness, as well as brightness, are a critical parameter for accuracte
camera calibration. For accessing these parameters for filtering out
problematic calibraiton images, this method calculates edge profiles by traveling from
black to white chessboard cell centers. Based on this, the number of pixels is
calculated required to transit from black to white. This width of the
transition area is a good indication of how sharp the chessboard is imaged
and should be below ~3.0 pixels.
<p>
@param image Gray image used to find chessboard corners
@param patternSize Size of a found chessboard pattern
@param corners Corners found by #findChessboardCornersSB
@param rise_distance Rise distance 0.8 means 10% ... 90% of the final signal strength
@param vertical By default edge responses for horizontal lines are calculated
@param sharpness Optional output array with a sharpness value for calculated edge responses (see description)
<p>
The optional sharpness array is of type CV_32FC1 and has for each calculated
profile one row with the following five entries:
* 0 = x coordinate of the underlying edge in the image
* 1 = y coordinate of the underlying edge in the image
* 2 = width of the transition area (sharpness)

<p>
@param objectPoints In the new interface it is a vector of vectors of calibration pattern points in
the calibration pattern coordinate space (e.g. std::vector<std::vector<cv::Vec3f>>). The outer
vector contains as many elements as the number of pattern views. If the same calibration pattern
is shown in each view and it is fully visible, all the vectors will be the same. Although, it is
possible to use partially occluded patterns or even different patterns in different views. Then,
the vectors will be different. Although the points are 3D, they all lie in the calibration pattern's
XY coordinate plane (thus 0 in the Z-coordinate), if the used calibration pattern is a planar rig.
In the old interface all the vectors of object points from different views are concatenated
together.
@param imagePoints In the new interface it is a vector of vectors of the projections of calibration
pattern points (e.g. std::vector<std::vector<cv::Vec2f>>). imagePoints.size() and
objectPoints.size(), and imagePoints[i].size() and objectPoints[i].size() for each i, must be equal,
respectively. In the old interface all the vectors of object points from different views are
concatenated together.
@param imageSize Size of the image used only to initialize the camera intrinsic matrix.
@param cameraMatrix Input/output 3x3 floating-point camera intrinsic matrix
{@code \cameramatrix{A}} . If \ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS
and/or \ref CALIB_FIX_ASPECT_RATIO, \ref CALIB_FIX_PRINCIPAL_POINT or \ref CALIB_FIX_FOCAL_LENGTH
are specified, some or all of fx, fy, cx, cy must be initialized before calling the function.
@param distCoeffs Input/output vector of distortion coefficients
{@code \distcoeffs}.
@param rvecs Output vector of rotation vectors (\ref Rodrigues ) estimated for each pattern view
(e.g. std::vector<cv::Mat>>). That is, each i-th rotation vector together with the corresponding
i-th translation vector (see the next output parameter description) brings the calibration pattern
from the object coordinate space (in which object points are specified) to the camera coordinate
space. In more technical terms, the tuple of the i-th rotation and translation vector performs
a change of basis from object coordinate space to camera coordinate space. Due to its duality, this
tuple is equivalent to the position of the calibration pattern with respect to the camera coordinate
space.
@param tvecs Output vector of translation vectors estimated for each pattern view, see parameter
describtion above.
@param stdDeviationsIntrinsics Output vector of standard deviations estimated for intrinsic
parameters. Order of deviations values:

 s_4, \tau_x, \tau_y)} If one of parameters is not estimated, it's deviation is equals to zero.
@param stdDeviationsExtrinsics Output vector of standard deviations estimated for extrinsic
parameters. Order of deviations values: {@code (R_0, T_0, \dotsc , R_{M - 1}, T_{M - 1})} where M is
the number of pattern views. {@code R_i, T_i} are concatenated 1x3 vectors.
 @param perViewErrors Output vector of the RMS re-projection error estimated for each pattern view.
@param flags Different flags that may be zero or a combination of the following values:
-   \ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS cameraMatrix contains valid initial values of
fx, fy, cx, cy that are optimized further. Otherwise, (cx, cy) is initially set to the image
center ( imageSize is used), and focal distances are computed in a least-squares fashion.
Note, that if intrinsic parameters are known, there is no need to use this function just to
estimate extrinsic parameters. Use \ref solvePnP instead.
-   \ref CALIB_FIX_PRINCIPAL_POINT The principal point is not changed during the global
optimization. It stays at the center or at a different location specified when
 \ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set too.
-   \ref CALIB_FIX_ASPECT_RATIO The functions consider only fy as a free parameter. The
ratio fx/fy stays the same as in the input cameraMatrix . When
 \ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is not set, the actual input values of fx and fy are
ignored, only their ratio is computed and used further.
-   \ref CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST Tangential distortion coefficients {@code (p_1, p_2)} are set
to zeros and stay zero.
-   \ref CALIB_FIX_FOCAL_LENGTH The focal length is not changed during the global optimization if
 \ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set.
-   \ref CALIB_FIX_K1,..., \ref CALIB_FIX_K6 The corresponding radial distortion
coefficient is not changed during the optimization. If \ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is
set, the coefficient from the supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
-   \ref CALIB_RATIONAL_MODEL Coefficients k4, k5, and k6 are enabled. To provide the
backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
calibration function use the rational model and return 8 coefficients or more.
-   \ref CALIB_THIN_PRISM_MODEL Coefficients s1, s2, s3 and s4 are enabled. To provide the
backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the
calibration function use the thin prism model and return 12 coefficients or more.
-   \ref CALIB_FIX_S1_S2_S3_S4 The thin prism distortion coefficients are not changed during
the optimization. If \ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the
supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
-   \ref CALIB_TILTED_MODEL Coefficients tauX and tauY are enabled. To provide the
backward compatibility, this extra flag should be explicitly specified to make the

-   \ref CALIB_FIX_TAUX_TAUY The coefficients of the tilted sensor model are not changed during
the optimization. If \ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is set, the coefficient from the
supplied distCoeffs matrix is used. Otherwise, it is set to 0.

<p>
The function estimates the intrinsic camera parameters and extrinsic parameters for each of the
views. The algorithm is based on \cite Zhang2000 and \cite BouguetMCT . The coordinates of 3D object
points and their corresponding 2D projections in each view must be specified. That may be achieved
by using an object with known geometry and easily detectable feature points. Such an object is
called a calibration rig or calibration pattern, and OpenCV has built-in support for a chessboard as
a calibration rig (see \ref findChessboardCorners). Currently, initialization of intrinsic
parameters (when \ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS is not set) is only implemented for planar calibration
patterns (where Z-coordinates of the object points must be all zeros). 3D calibration rigs can also
be used as long as initial cameraMatrix is provided.
<p>
The algorithm performs the following steps:
<p>
-   Compute the initial intrinsic parameters (the option only available for planar calibration
    patterns) or read them from the input parameters. The distortion coefficients are all set to
    zeros initially unless some of CALIB_FIX_K? are specified.
<p>
-   Estimate the initial camera pose as if the intrinsic parameters have been already known. This is
    done using \ref solvePnP .
<p>
-   Run the global Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm to minimize the reprojection error,
    that is, the total sum of squared distances between the observed feature points imagePoints and
    the projected (using the current estimates for camera parameters and the poses) object points
    objectPoints. See \ref projectPoints for details.
<p>
\note
    If you use a non-square (i.e. non-N-by-N) grid and \ref findChessboardCorners for calibration,
    and \ref calibrateCamera returns bad values (zero distortion coefficients, {@code c_x} and
    {@code c_y} very far from the image center, and/or large differences between {@code f_x} and
    {@code f_y} (ratios of 10:1 or more)), then you are probably using patternSize=cvSize(rows,cols)
    instead of using patternSize=cvSize(cols,rows) in \ref findChessboardCorners.
<p>
\note
    The function may throw exceptions, if unsupported combination of parameters is provided or
    the system is underconstrained.

/** \brief Finds the camera intrinsic and extrinsic parameters from several views of a calibration pattern.
<p>
This function is an extension of #calibrateCamera with the method of releasing object which was
proposed in \cite strobl2011iccv. In many common cases with inaccurate, unmeasured, roughly planar
targets (calibration plates), this method can dramatically improve the precision of the estimated
camera parameters. Both the object-releasing method and standard method are supported by this
function. Use the parameter **iFixedPoint** for method selection. In the internal implementation,
#calibrateCamera is a wrapper for this function.
<p>
@param objectPoints Vector of vectors of calibration pattern points in the calibration pattern
coordinate space. See #calibrateCamera for details. If the method of releasing object to be used,
the identical calibration board must be used in each view and it must be fully visible, and all
objectPoints[i] must be the same and all points should be roughly close to a plane. **The calibration
target has to be rigid, or at least static if the camera (rather than the calibration target) is
shifted for grabbing images.**
@param imagePoints Vector of vectors of the projections of calibration pattern points. See
#calibrateCamera for details.
@param imageSize Size of the image used only to initialize the intrinsic camera matrix.
@param iFixedPoint The index of the 3D object point in objectPoints[0] to be fixed. It also acts as
a switch for calibration method selection. If object-releasing method to be used, pass in the
parameter in the range of [1, objectPoints[0].size()-2], otherwise a value out of this range will
make standard calibration method selected. Usually the top-right corner point of the calibration
board grid is recommended to be fixed when object-releasing method being utilized. According to
\cite strobl2011iccv, two other points are also fixed. In this implementation, objectPoints[0].front
and objectPoints[0].back.z are used. With object-releasing method, accurate rvecs, tvecs and
newObjPoints are only possible if coordinates of these three fixed points are accurate enough.
@param cameraMatrix Output 3x3 floating-point camera matrix. See #calibrateCamera for details.
@param distCoeffs Output vector of distortion coefficients. See #calibrateCamera for details.
@param rvecs Output vector of rotation vectors estimated for each pattern view. See #calibrateCamera
for details.
@param tvecs Output vector of translation vectors estimated for each pattern view.
@param newObjPoints The updated output vector of calibration pattern points. The coordinates might
be scaled based on three fixed points. The returned coordinates are accurate only if the above
mentioned three fixed points are accurate. If not needed, noArray() can be passed in. This parameter
is ignored with standard calibration method.
@param stdDeviationsIntrinsics Output vector of standard deviations estimated for intrinsic parameters.
See #calibrateCamera for details.
@param stdDeviationsExtrinsics Output vector of standard deviations estimated for extrinsic parameters.
See #calibrateCamera for details.
@param stdDeviationsObjPoints Output vector of standard deviations estimated for refined coordinates
of calibration pattern points. It has the same size and order as objectPoints[0] vector. This
parameter is ignored with standard calibration method.
 @param perViewErrors Output vector of the RMS re-projection error estimated for each pattern view.
@param flags Different flags that may be zero or a combination of some predefined values. See
#calibrateCamera for details. If the method of releasing object is used, the calibration time may
be much longer. CALIB_USE_QR or CALIB_USE_LU could be used for faster calibration with potentially
less precise and less stable in some rare cases.
@param criteria Termination criteria for the iterative optimization algorithm.
<p>
@return the overall RMS re-projection error.

The function estimates the intrinsic camera parameters and extrinsic parameters for each of the

/** \brief Calibrates a stereo camera set up. This function finds the intrinsic parameters
for each of the two cameras and the extrinsic parameters between the two cameras.
<p>
@param objectPoints Vector of vectors of the calibration pattern points. The same structure as
in \ref calibrateCamera. For each pattern view, both cameras need to see the same object
points. Therefore, objectPoints.size(), imagePoints1.size(), and imagePoints2.size() need to be
equal as well as objectPoints[i].size(), imagePoints1[i].size(), and imagePoints2[i].size() need to
be equal for each i.
@param imagePoints1 Vector of vectors of the projections of the calibration pattern points,
observed by the first camera. The same structure as in \ref calibrateCamera.
@param imagePoints2 Vector of vectors of the projections of the calibration pattern points,
observed by the second camera. The same structure as in \ref calibrateCamera.
@param cameraMatrix1 Input/output camera intrinsic matrix for the first camera, the same as in
\ref calibrateCamera. Furthermore, for the stereo case, additional flags may be used, see below.
@param distCoeffs1 Input/output vector of distortion coefficients, the same as in
\ref calibrateCamera.
@param cameraMatrix2 Input/output second camera intrinsic matrix for the second camera. See description for
cameraMatrix1.
@param distCoeffs2 Input/output lens distortion coefficients for the second camera. See
description for distCoeffs1.
@param imageSize Size of the image used only to initialize the camera intrinsic matrices.
@param R Output rotation matrix. Together with the translation vector T, this matrix brings
points given in the first camera's coordinate system to points in the second camera's
coordinate system. In more technical terms, the tuple of R and T performs a change of basis
from the first camera's coordinate system to the second camera's coordinate system. Due to its
duality, this tuple is equivalent to the position of the first camera with respect to the
second camera coordinate system.
@param T Output translation vector, see description above.
@param E Output essential matrix.
@param F Output fundamental matrix.
@param rvecs Output vector of rotation vectors ( \ref Rodrigues ) estimated for each pattern view in the
coordinate system of the first camera of the stereo pair (e.g. std::vector<cv::Mat>). More in detail, each
i-th rotation vector together with the corresponding i-th translation vector (see the next output parameter
description) brings the calibration pattern from the object coordinate space (in which object points are
specified) to the camera coordinate space of the first camera of the stereo pair. In more technical terms,
the tuple of the i-th rotation and translation vector performs a change of basis from object coordinate space
to camera coordinate space of the first camera of the stereo pair.
@param tvecs Output vector of translation vectors estimated for each pattern view, see parameter description
of previous output parameter ( rvecs ).
@param perViewErrors Output vector of the RMS re-projection error estimated for each pattern view.
@param flags Different flags that may be zero or a combination of the following values:
-   \ref CALIB_FIX_INTRINSIC Fix cameraMatrix? and distCoeffs? so that only R, T, E, and F
matrices are estimated.
-   \ref CALIB_USE_INTRINSIC_GUESS Optimize some or all of the intrinsic parameters
according to the specified flags. Initial values are provided by the user.
-   \ref CALIB_USE_EXTRINSIC_GUESS R and T contain valid initial values that are optimized further.
Otherwise R and T are initialized to the median value of the pattern views (each dimension separately).

-   \ref CALIB_TILTED_MODEL Coefficients tauX and tauY are enabled. To provide the

@param criteria Termination criteria for the iterative optimization algorithm.
<p>
The function estimates the transformation between two cameras making a stereo pair. If one computes
the poses of an object relative to the first camera and to the second camera,
( {@code R_1},{@code T_1} ) and ({@code R_2},{@code T_2}), respectively, for a stereo camera where the
relative position and orientation between the two cameras are fixed, then those poses definitely
relate to each other. This means, if the relative position and orientation ({@code R},{@code T}) of the
two cameras is known, it is possible to compute ({@code R_2},{@code T_2}) when ({@code R_1},{@code T_1}) is
given. This is what the described function does. It computes ({@code R},{@code T}) such that:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[R_2=R R_1\]}</pre>
<pre>{@code \[T_2=R T_1 + T.\]}</pre>
<p>
Therefore, one can compute the coordinate representation of a 3D point for the second camera's
coordinate system when given the point's coordinate representation in the first camera's coordinate
system:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[\begin{bmatrix}
X_2 \\
Y_2 \\
Z_2 \\
1
\end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}
R & T \\
0 & 1
\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}
X_1 \\
Y_1 \\
Z_1 \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.\]}</pre>
<p>
<p>
Optionally, it computes the essential matrix E:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[E= \vecthreethree{0}{-T_2}{T_1}{T_2}{0}{-T_0}{-T_1}{T_0}{0} R\]}</pre>
<p>
where {@code T_i} are components of the translation vector {@code T} : {@code T=[T_0, T_1, T_2]^T} .
And the function can also compute the fundamental matrix F:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[F = cameraMatrix2^{-T}\cdot E \cdot cameraMatrix1^{-1}\]}</pre>
<p>
Besides the stereo-related information, the function can also perform a full calibration of each of
the two cameras. However, due to the high dimensionality of the parameter space and noise in the
input data, the function can diverge from the correct solution. If the intrinsic parameters can be
estimated with high accuracy for each of the cameras individually (for example, using
#calibrateCamera ), you are recommended to do so and then pass \ref CALIB_FIX_INTRINSIC flag to the
function along with the computed intrinsic parameters. Otherwise, if all the parameters are
estimated at once, it makes sense to restrict some parameters, for example, pass
 \ref CALIB_SAME_FOCAL_LENGTH and \ref CALIB_ZERO_TANGENT_DIST flags, which is usually a
reasonable assumption.
<p>
Similarly to #calibrateCamera, the function minimizes the total re-projection error for all the
points in all the available views from both cameras. The function returns the final value of the
re-projection error.

/** \brief Computes rectification transforms for each head of a calibrated stereo camera.
<p>
@param cameraMatrix1 First camera intrinsic matrix.
@param distCoeffs1 First camera distortion parameters.
@param cameraMatrix2 Second camera intrinsic matrix.
@param distCoeffs2 Second camera distortion parameters.
@param imageSize Size of the image used for stereo calibration.
@param R Rotation matrix from the coordinate system of the first camera to the second camera,
see \ref stereoCalibrate.
@param T Translation vector from the coordinate system of the first camera to the second camera,
see \ref stereoCalibrate.
@param R1 Output 3x3 rectification transform (rotation matrix) for the first camera. This matrix
brings points given in the unrectified first camera's coordinate system to points in the rectified
first camera's coordinate system. In more technical terms, it performs a change of basis from the
unrectified first camera's coordinate system to the rectified first camera's coordinate system.
@param R2 Output 3x3 rectification transform (rotation matrix) for the second camera. This matrix
brings points given in the unrectified second camera's coordinate system to points in the rectified
second camera's coordinate system. In more technical terms, it performs a change of basis from the
unrectified second camera's coordinate system to the rectified second camera's coordinate system.
@param P1 Output 3x4 projection matrix in the new (rectified) coordinate systems for the first
camera, i.e. it projects points given in the rectified first camera coordinate system into the
rectified first camera's image.
@param P2 Output 3x4 projection matrix in the new (rectified) coordinate systems for the second
camera, i.e. it projects points given in the rectified first camera coordinate system into the
rectified second camera's image.
@param Q Output {@code 4 \times 4} disparity-to-depth mapping matrix (see \ref reprojectImageTo3D).
@param flags Operation flags that may be zero or \ref CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY . If the flag is set,
the function makes the principal points of each camera have the same pixel coordinates in the
rectified views. And if the flag is not set, the function may still shift the images in the
horizontal or vertical direction (depending on the orientation of epipolar lines) to maximize the
useful image area.
@param alpha Free scaling parameter. If it is -1 or absent, the function performs the default
scaling. Otherwise, the parameter should be between 0 and 1. alpha=0 means that the rectified
images are zoomed and shifted so that only valid pixels are visible (no black areas after
rectification). alpha=1 means that the rectified image is decimated and shifted so that all the
pixels from the original images from the cameras are retained in the rectified images (no source
image pixels are lost). Any intermediate value yields an intermediate result between
those two extreme cases.
@param newImageSize New image resolution after rectification. The same size should be passed to
#initUndistortRectifyMap (see the stereo_calib.cpp sample in OpenCV samples directory). When (0,0)
is passed (default), it is set to the original imageSize . Setting it to a larger value can help you
preserve details in the original image, especially when there is a big radial distortion.
@param validPixROI1 Optional output rectangles inside the rectified images where all the pixels
are valid. If alpha=0 , the ROIs cover the whole images. Otherwise, they are likely to be smaller
(see the picture below).
@param validPixROI2 Optional output rectangles inside the rectified images where all the pixels
are valid. If alpha=0 , the ROIs cover the whole images. Otherwise, they are likely to be smaller
(see the picture below).
<p>
The function computes the rotation matrices for each camera that (virtually) make both camera image
planes the same plane. Consequently, this makes all the epipolar lines parallel and thus simplifies
the dense stereo correspondence problem. The function takes the matrices computed by #stereoCalibrate
as input. As output, it provides two rotation matrices and also two projection matrices in the new
coordinates. The function distinguishes the following two cases:
<p>
-   **Horizontal stereo**: the first and the second camera views are shifted relative to each other
    mainly along the x-axis (with possible small vertical shift). In the rectified images, the
    corresponding epipolar lines in the left and right cameras are horizontal and have the same
    y-coordinate. P1 and P2 look like:
    <p>
    <pre>{@code \[\texttt{P1} = \begin{bmatrix}
                        f & 0 & cx_1 & 0 \\
                        0 & f & cy & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0
                     \end{bmatrix}\]}</pre>
    <p>
    <pre>{@code \[\texttt{P2} = \begin{bmatrix}
                        f & 0 & cx_2 & T_x \cdot f \\
                        0 & f & cy & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0
                     \end{bmatrix} ,\]}</pre>
    <p>
    <pre>{@code \[\texttt{Q} = \begin{bmatrix}
                        1 & 0 & 0 & -cx_1 \\
                        0 & 1 & 0 & -cy \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & f \\
                        0 & 0 & -\frac{1}{T_x} & \frac{cx_1 - cx_2}{T_x}
                    \end{bmatrix} \]}</pre>
    <p>
    where {@code T_x} is a horizontal shift between the cameras and {@code cx_1=cx_2} if
    \ref CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY is set.
<p>
-   **Vertical stereo**: the first and the second camera views are shifted relative to each other
    mainly in the vertical direction (and probably a bit in the horizontal direction too). The epipolar
    lines in the rectified images are vertical and have the same x-coordinate. P1 and P2 look like:
    <p>
    <pre>{@code \[\texttt{P1} = \begin{bmatrix}
                        f & 0 & cx & 0 \\
                        0 & f & cy_1 & 0 \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0
                     \end{bmatrix}\]}</pre>
    <p>
    <pre>{@code \[\texttt{P2} = \begin{bmatrix}
                        f & 0 & cx & 0 \\
                        0 & f & cy_2 & T_y \cdot f \\
                        0 & 0 & 1 & 0
                     \end{bmatrix},\]}</pre>
    <p>
    <pre>{@code \[\texttt{Q} = \begin{bmatrix}
                        1 & 0 & 0 & -cx \\
                        0 & 1 & 0 & -cy_1 \\
                        0 & 0 & 0 & f \\
                        0 & 0 & -\frac{1}{T_y} & \frac{cy_1 - cy_2}{T_y}
                    \end{bmatrix} \]}</pre>
    <p>
    where {@code T_y} is a vertical shift between the cameras and {@code cy_1=cy_2} if
    \ref CALIB_ZERO_DISPARITY is set.
<p>
As you can see, the first three columns of P1 and P2 will effectively be the new "rectified" camera
matrices. The matrices, together with R1 and R2 , can then be passed to #initUndistortRectifyMap to
initialize the rectification map for each camera.
<p>
See below the screenshot from the stereo_calib.cpp sample. Some red horizontal lines pass through
the corresponding image regions. This means that the images are well rectified, which is what most
stereo correspondence algorithms rely on. The green rectangles are roi1 and roi2 . You see that
their interiors are all valid pixels.

/** \brief Computes a rectification transform for an uncalibrated stereo camera.
<p>
@param points1 Array of feature points in the first image.
@param points2 The corresponding points in the second image. The same formats as in
#findFundamentalMat are supported.
@param F Input fundamental matrix. It can be computed from the same set of point pairs using
#findFundamentalMat .
@param imgSize Size of the image.
@param H1 Output rectification homography matrix for the first image.
@param H2 Output rectification homography matrix for the second image.
@param threshold Optional threshold used to filter out the outliers. If the parameter is greater
than zero, all the point pairs that do not comply with the epipolar geometry (that is, the points
for which {@code |\texttt{points2[i]}^T \cdot \texttt{F} \cdot \texttt{points1[i]}|>\texttt{threshold}} )
are rejected prior to computing the homographies. Otherwise, all the points are considered inliers.
<p>
The function computes the rectification transformations without knowing intrinsic parameters of the
cameras and their relative position in the space, which explains the suffix "uncalibrated". Another
related difference from #stereoRectify is that the function outputs not the rectification
transformations in the object (3D) space, but the planar perspective transformations encoded by the
homography matrices H1 and H2 . The function implements the algorithm \cite Hartley99 .
<p>
\note
   While the algorithm does not need to know the intrinsic parameters of the cameras, it heavily
    depends on the epipolar geometry. Therefore, if the camera lenses have a significant distortion,
    it would be better to correct it before computing the fundamental matrix and calling this
    function. For example, distortion coefficients can be estimated for each head of stereo camera
    separately by using #calibrateCamera . Then, the images can be corrected using #undistort , or
    just the point coordinates can be corrected with #undistortPoints .

@param newImgSize Image size after rectification. By default, it is set to imageSize .
@param validPixROI Optional output rectangle that outlines all-good-pixels region in the
undistorted image. See roi1, roi2 description in #stereoRectify .
@param centerPrincipalPoint Optional flag that indicates whether in the new camera intrinsic matrix the
principal point should be at the image center or not. By default, the principal point is chosen to

@return new_camera_matrix Output new camera intrinsic matrix.
<p>
The function computes and returns the optimal new camera intrinsic matrix based on the free scaling parameter.
By varying this parameter, you may retrieve only sensible pixels alpha=0 , keep all the original
image pixels if there is valuable information in the corners alpha=1 , or get something in between.
When alpha\>0 , the undistorted result is likely to have some black pixels corresponding to
"virtual" pixels outside of the captured distorted image. The original camera intrinsic matrix, distortion
coefficients, the computed new camera intrinsic matrix, and newImageSize should be passed to
#initUndistortRectifyMap to produce the maps for #remap .

Another approach consists in estimating simultaneously the rotation and the translation (simultaneous solutions),
with the following implemented methods:

The following picture describes the Hand-Eye calibration problem where the transformation between a camera ("eye")
mounted on a robot gripper ("hand") has to be estimated. This configuration is called eye-in-hand.
<p>
The eye-to-hand configuration consists in a static camera observing a calibration pattern mounted on the robot
end-effector. The transformation from the camera to the robot base frame can then be estimated by inputting
the suitable transformations to the function, see below.

The calibration procedure is the following:
  - a static calibration pattern is used to estimate the transformation between the target frame
  and the camera frame
  - the robot gripper is moved in order to acquire several poses
  - for each pose, the homogeneous transformation between the gripper frame and the robot base frame is recorded using for
  instance the robot kinematics

Additional information can be found on this [website](http://campar.in.tum.de/Chair/HandEyeCalibration).
\note
A minimum of 2 motions with non parallel rotation axes are necessary to determine the hand-eye transformation.
So at least 3 different poses are required, but it is strongly recommended to use many more poses.

<p>
@param points1 Array of N points from the first image. The point coordinates should be
floating-point (single or double precision).
@param points2 Array of the second image points of the same size and format as points1 .
@param method Method for computing a fundamental matrix.
-   \ref FM_7POINT for a 7-point algorithm. {@code N = 7}
-   \ref FM_8POINT for an 8-point algorithm. {@code N \ge 8}
-   \ref FM_RANSAC for the RANSAC algorithm. {@code N \ge 8}
-   \ref FM_LMEDS for the LMedS algorithm. {@code N \ge 8}
@param ransacReprojThreshold Parameter used only for RANSAC. It is the maximum distance from a point to an epipolar
line in pixels, beyond which the point is considered an outlier and is not used for computing the
final fundamental matrix. It can be set to something like 1-3, depending on the accuracy of the
point localization, image resolution, and the image noise.
@param confidence Parameter used for the RANSAC and LMedS methods only. It specifies a desirable level
of confidence (probability) that the estimated matrix is correct.
@param mask [out] optional output mask
@param maxIters The maximum number of robust method iterations.
<p>
The epipolar geometry is described by the following equation:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[[p_2; 1]^T F [p_1; 1] = 0\]}</pre>
<p>
where {@code F} is a fundamental matrix, {@code p_1} and {@code p_2} are corresponding points in the first and the
second images, respectively.
<p>
The function calculates the fundamental matrix using one of four methods listed above and returns
the found fundamental matrix. Normally just one matrix is found. But in case of the 7-point
algorithm, the function may return up to 3 solutions ( {@code 9 \times 3} matrix that stores all 3
matrices sequentially).
<p>
The calculated fundamental matrix may be passed further to #computeCorrespondEpilines that finds the
epipolar lines corresponding to the specified points. It can also be passed to
#stereoRectifyUncalibrated to compute the rectification transformation. :
<pre>{@code
    // Example. Estimation of fundamental matrix using the RANSAC algorithm
    int point_count = 100;
    vector<Point2f> points1(point_count);
    vector<Point2f> points2(point_count);

line in pixels, beyond which the point is considered an outlier and is not used for computing the
final fundamental matrix. It can be set to something like 1-3, depending on the accuracy of the
point localization, image resolution, and the image noise.

inliers in points1 and points2 for then given essential matrix E. Only these inliers will be used to
recover pose. In the output mask only inliers which pass the cheirality check.

This function decomposes an essential matrix using \ref decomposeEssentialMat and then verifies
possible pose hypotheses by doing cheirality check. The cheirality check means that the
triangulated 3D points should have positive depth. Some details can be found in \cite Nister03.

/** \brief Recovers the relative camera rotation and the translation from an estimated essential
matrix and the corresponding points in two images, using chirality check. Returns the number of
inliers that pass the check.
<p>
@param E The input essential matrix.
@param points1 Array of N 2D points from the first image. The point coordinates should be
floating-point (single or double precision).
@param points2 Array of the second image points of the same size and format as points1 .
@param cameraMatrix Camera intrinsic matrix {@code \cameramatrix{A}} .
Note that this function assumes that points1 and points2 are feature points from cameras with the
same camera intrinsic matrix.
@param R Output rotation matrix. Together with the translation vector, this matrix makes up a tuple
that performs a change of basis from the first camera's coordinate system to the second camera's
coordinate system. Note that, in general, t can not be used for this tuple, see the parameter
described below.
@param t Output translation vector. This vector is obtained by \ref decomposeEssentialMat and
therefore is only known up to scale, i.e. t is the direction of the translation vector and has unit
length.
@param mask Input/output mask for inliers in points1 and points2. If it is not empty, then it marks
inliers in points1 and points2 for the given essential matrix E. Only these inliers will be used to
recover pose. In the output mask only inliers which pass the chirality check.
<p>
This function decomposes an essential matrix using \ref decomposeEssentialMat and then verifies
possible pose hypotheses by doing chirality check. The chirality check means that the
triangulated 3D points should have positive depth. Some details can be found in \cite Nister03.
<p>
This function can be used to process the output E and mask from \ref findEssentialMat. In this
scenario, points1 and points2 are the same input for #findEssentialMat :
<pre>{@code
    // Example. Estimation of fundamental matrix using the RANSAC algorithm
    int point_count = 100;
    vector<Point2f> points1(point_count);
    vector<Point2f> points2(point_count);

    // initialize the points here ...
    for( int i = 0; i < point_count; i++ )
    {
        points1[i] = ...;
        points2[i] = ...;
    }

    // cametra matrix with both focal lengths = 1, and principal point = (0, 0)
    Mat cameraMatrix = Mat::eye(3, 3, CV_64F);

    Mat E, R, t, mask;

    E = findEssentialMat(points1, points2, cameraMatrix, RANSAC, 0.999, 1.0, mask);
    recoverPose(E, points1, points2, cameraMatrix, R, t, mask);

\ref StereoSGBM and maybe other algorithms, it should be divided by 16 (and scaled to float) before
being used here.
@param _3dImage Output 3-channel floating-point image of the same size as disparity. Each element of
_3dImage(x,y) contains 3D coordinates of the point (x,y) computed from the disparity map. If one
uses Q obtained by \ref stereoRectify, then the returned points are represented in the first
camera's rectified coordinate system.
@param Q {@code 4 \times 4} perspective transformation matrix that can be obtained with
\ref stereoRectify.
@param handleMissingValues Indicates, whether the function should handle missing values (i.e.
points where the disparity was not computed). If handleMissingValues=true, then pixels with the
minimal disparity that corresponds to the outliers (see StereoMatcher::compute ) are transformed
to 3D points with a very large Z value (currently set to 10000).
@param ddepth The optional output array depth. If it is -1, the output image will have CV_32F
depth. ddepth can also be set to CV_16S, CV_32S or CV_32F.
<p>
The function transforms a single-channel disparity map to a 3-channel image representing a 3D
surface. That is, for each pixel (x,y) and the corresponding disparity d=disparity(x,y) , it
computes:
<p>
<pre>{@code \[\begin{bmatrix}
X \\
Y \\
Z \\
W
\end{bmatrix} = Q \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
\texttt{disparity} (x,y) \\
z
\end{bmatrix}.\]}</pre>

   To reproject a sparse set of points {(x,y,d),...} to 3D space, use perspectiveTransform.

/** \brief Decompose a homography matrix to rotation(s), translation(s) and plane normal(s).
<p>
@param H The input homography matrix between two images.
@param K The input camera intrinsic matrix.
@param rotations Array of rotation matrices.
@param translations Array of translation matrices.
@param normals Array of plane normal matrices.
<p>
This function extracts relative camera motion between two views of a planar object and returns up to
four mathematical solution tuples of rotation, translation, and plane normal. The decomposition of
the homography matrix H is described in detail in \cite Malis2007.
<p>
If the homography H, induced by the plane, gives the constraint
<pre>{@code \[s_i \vecthree{x'_i}{y'_i}{1} \sim H \vecthree{x_i}{y_i}{1}\]}</pre> on the source image points
{@code p_i} and the destination image points {@code p'_i}, then the tuple of rotations[k] and
translations[k] is a change of basis from the source camera's coordinate system to the destination
camera's coordinate system. However, by decomposing H, one can only get the translation normalized
by the (typically unknown) depth of the scene, i.e. its direction but with normalized length.
<p>
If point correspondences are available, at least two solutions may further be invalidated, by
applying positive depth constraint, i.e. all points must be in front of the camera.

<p>
This function is intended to filter the output of the #decomposeHomographyMat based on additional
information as described in \cite Malis2007 . The summary of the method: the #decomposeHomographyMat function
returns 2 unique solutions and their "opposites" for a total of 4 solutions. If we have access to the
sets of points visible in the camera frame before and after the homography transformation is applied,
we can determine which are the true potential solutions and which are the opposites by verifying which
homographies are consistent with all visible reference points being in front of the camera. The inputs
are left unchanged; the filtered solution set is returned as indices into the existing one.

<p>
The function transforms an image to compensate radial and tangential lens distortion.
<p>
The function is simply a combination of #initUndistortRectifyMap (with unity R ) and #remap
(with bilinear interpolation). See the former function for details of the transformation being
performed.
<p>
Those pixels in the destination image, for which there is no correspondent pixels in the source
image, are filled with zeros (black color).
<p>
A particular subset of the source image that will be visible in the corrected image can be regulated
by newCameraMatrix. You can use #getOptimalNewCameraMatrix to compute the appropriate
newCameraMatrix depending on your requirements.
<p>
The camera matrix and the distortion parameters can be determined using #calibrateCamera. If
the resolution of images is different from the resolution used at the calibration stage, {@code f_x,
f_y, c_x} and {@code c_y} need to be scaled accordingly, while the distortion coefficients remain
the same.

<p>
The function computes the joint undistortion and rectification transformation and represents the
result in the form of maps for #remap. The undistorted image looks like original, as if it is
captured with a camera using the camera matrix =newCameraMatrix and zero distortion. In case of a
monocular camera, newCameraMatrix is usually equal to cameraMatrix, or it can be computed by
#getOptimalNewCameraMatrix for a better control over scaling. In case of a stereo camera,
newCameraMatrix is normally set to P1 or P2 computed by #stereoRectify .
<p>
Also, this new camera is oriented differently in the coordinate space, according to R. That, for
example, helps to align two heads of a stereo camera so that the epipolar lines on both images
become horizontal and have the same y- coordinate (in case of a horizontally aligned stereo camera).
<p>
The function actually builds the maps for the inverse mapping algorithm that is used by #remap. That
is, for each pixel {@code (u, v)} in the destination (corrected and rectified) image, the function
computes the corresponding coordinates in the source image (that is, in the original image from
camera). The following process is applied:

/** \brief Computes the projection and inverse-rectification transformation map. In essense, this is the inverse of
#initUndistortRectifyMap to accomodate stereo-rectification of projectors ('inverse-cameras') in projector-camera pairs.
<p>
The function computes the joint projection and inverse rectification transformation and represents the
result in the form of maps for #remap. The projected image looks like a distorted version of the original which,
once projected by a projector, should visually match the original. In case of a monocular camera, newCameraMatrix
is usually equal to cameraMatrix, or it can be computed by
#getOptimalNewCameraMatrix for a better control over scaling. In case of a projector-camera pair,
newCameraMatrix is normally set to P1 or P2 computed by #stereoRectify .
<p>
The projector is oriented differently in the coordinate space, according to R. In case of projector-camera pairs,
this helps align the projector (in the same manner as #initUndistortRectifyMap for the camera) to create a stereo-rectified pair. This
allows epipolar lines on both images to become horizontal and have the same y-coordinate (in case of a horizontally aligned projector-camera pair).
<p>
The function builds the maps for the inverse mapping algorithm that is used by #remap. That
is, for each pixel {@code (u, v)} in the destination (projected and inverse-rectified) image, the function
computes the corresponding coordinates in the source image (that is, in the original digital image). The following process is applied:

<p>
In case of a stereo-rectified projector-camera pair, this function is called for the projector while #initUndistortRectifyMap is called for the camera head.
This is done after #stereoRectify, which in turn is called after #stereoCalibrate. If the projector-camera pair
is not calibrated, it is still possible to compute the rectification transformations directly from

/** \brief Computes the ideal point coordinates from the observed point coordinates.
<p>
The function is similar to #undistort and #initUndistortRectifyMap but it operates on a
sparse set of points instead of a raster image. Also the function performs a reverse transformation
to  #projectPoints. In case of a 3D object, it does not reconstruct its 3D coordinates, but for a
planar object, it does, up to a translation vector, if the proper R is specified.
<p>
For each observed point coordinate {@code (u, v)} the function computes:
<pre>{@code \[
\begin{array}{l}
x^{"}  \leftarrow (u - c_x)/f_x  \\
y^{"}  \leftarrow (v - c_y)/f_y  \\
(x',y') = undistort(x^{"},y^{"}, \texttt{distCoeffs}) \\
{[X\,Y\,W]} ^T  \leftarrow R*[x' \, y' \, 1]^T  \\
x  \leftarrow X/W  \\
y  \leftarrow Y/W  \\
\text{only performed if P is specified:} \\
u'  \leftarrow x {f'}_x + {c'}_x  \\
v'  \leftarrow y {f'}_y + {c'}_y
\end{array}
\]}</pre>
<p>
where *undistort* is an approximate iterative algorithm that estimates the normalized original
point coordinates out of the normalized distorted point coordinates ("normalized" means that the
coordinates do not depend on the camera matrix).
<p>
The function can be used for both a stereo camera head or a monocular camera (when R is empty).
@param src Observed point coordinates, 2xN/Nx2 1-channel or 1xN/Nx1 2-channel (CV_32FC2 or CV_64FC2) (or
vector\<Point2f\> ).
@param dst Output ideal point coordinates (1xN/Nx1 2-channel or vector\<Point2f\> ) after undistortion and reverse perspective
transformation. If matrix P is identity or omitted, dst will contain normalized point coordinates.
@param cameraMatrix Camera matrix {@code \vecthreethree{f_x}{0}{c_x}{0}{f_y}{c_y}{0}{0}{1}} .
@param distCoeffs Input vector of distortion coefficients
{@code (k_1, k_2, p_1, p_2[, k_3[, k_4, k_5, k_6[, s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4[, \tau_x, \tau_y]]]])}
of 4, 5, 8, 12 or 14 elements. If the vector is NULL/empty, the zero distortion coefficients are assumed.
@param R Rectification transformation in the object space (3x3 matrix). R1 or R2 computed by
#stereoRectify can be passed here. If the matrix is empty, the identity transformation is used.
@param P New camera matrix (3x3) or new projection matrix (3x4) {@code \begin{bmatrix} {f'}_x & 0 & {c'}_x & t_x \\ 0 & {f'}_y & {c'}_y & t_y \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & t_z \end{bmatrix}}. P1 or P2 computed by
#stereoRectify can be passed here. If the matrix is empty, the identity new camera matrix is used.
